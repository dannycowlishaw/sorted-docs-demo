This section explains how to configure allocation rules that PRO can use when selecting carrier services, and the various methods you can use to allocate consignments to those services. What Is Allocation? In the context of SortedPRO, allocation is the process of selecting the carrier service that will be used to deliver a consignment. Allocation is a key part of all PRO workflows, as a consignment cannot be shipped if it has not previously been allocated to a suitable carrier service. Caution You can only allocate consignments that are in a consignment state of either Unallocated or Allocation Failed . If you attempt to allocate a consignment that is not in one of those states, PRO returns an error. To allocate a consignment in PRO, you'll need to call one of PRO's allocation endpoints. You can specify a carrier service to allocate to, allocate based on a quote you received, or have PRO select the cheapest eligible carrier service for you. Whichever endpoint you use, PRO uses pre-defined allocation rules to ensure that your consignment is allocated to a suitable carrier service. PRO offers the following allocation endpoints: Endpoint Description API Reference Allocate Using Default Rules PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/allocate Allocates one or more consignments based on your organisation's custom allocation rules Link Allocate Consignment PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/{consignmentReference}/allocatewithcheapestquote Allocates a single consignment to the cheapest available carrier service Link Allocate Consignment With Service Group PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/{consignmentReference}/allocatewithservicegroup/{mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference} Allocates a consignment to the cheapest available carrier service in a particular carrier service group Link Allocate With Carrier Service PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/allocatewithcarrierservice Allocates one or more consignments to a specific carrier service Link Allocate With Quote PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/{consignmentReference}/allocatewithquote/{quoteReference} Allocates an individual consignment based on a specific delivery quote from a carrier Link Note For detailed information on using each of PRO's allocation endpoints, click the endpoint names in the table above. When a consignment is allocated to a carrier service, its status changes to Allocated , enabling you to retrieve its package labels and (where applicable) customs documentation. PRO also returns an Allocation Summary, confirming the service that the consignment was allocated to and (where applicable) providing tracking details. What Is an Allocation Rule? When you make an allocation request for a consignment, PRO uses its allocation rules to ascertain which carrier services are eligible to ship that consignment and which are not. Allocation rules are optional criteria that define the consignments that a particular carrier service is eligible to take. You can specify the following: Maximum and minimum dimensions and weight Maximum monetary value Excluded UK postcode areas Excluded countries Allocation tags. For example, you could specify that a particular carrier service should only be allocated consignments that weigh between 1-25 Kg. Subsequently, PRO would not consider this service when allocating a consignment with a weight of 30Kg. Configuring Allocation Rules Allocation rules must be configured in the PRO UI. To configure allocation rules: Log in to the PRO UI and open the Carrier Services page ( Settings > Carrier Services ) to display a list of available carrier services. Select the carrier service you want to configure rules for and then click Allocation Rules to display the Manage Carrier Service Rules page. If required, enter maximum dimensions or weights. To do so: In the Dimensions panel, click Add on the rule you want to set up (one of Allowed Weight , Allowed Girth , or Allowed Length ). PRO displays editable range fields. Enter the range values for the rule. Click Save to confirm your changes. PRO displays your new rule under the relevant field. You can edit your new rule using the range boxes, or click Remove to remove it altogether. If required, enter an Allowed Compensation Value . This is the maximum monetary consignment value that the service can take. If required, add an allocation tag by entering the tag name into the Allocation Filtering Tags field and clicking Add . PRO will only allocate those consignments that have a corresponding value in their tags property to the carrier service. To remove a tag from a carrier service, click the x on its icon. Note For more information on how allocation tags work, see What Is an Allocation Tag? . If required, enter a UK postcode restriction. To do so, enter the postcode area , district , sector , and/or unit you want to restrict delivery to into the fields on the Geographic Availability panel and then click the Add button. PRO displays the restricted postcode area in the panel. To remove a restriction, click Remove . Note The Geographic Availability fields enable you to be flexible when restricting postcodes for a carrier service. For example, if you wanted to prevent a carrier service from being allocated to any consignments bound for the specific postcode M2 6LW , you would enter the following: area - M district - 2 sector - 6 unit - LW However, if you wanted to prevent the service from being allocated to any consignments bound for the entire M2 postcode area, you could simple enter M into the area field and 2 into the district field, and leave the more specific fields blank. For more information on UK postcode structures, see this article . If required, enter international delivery restrictions. To do so, start typing the name of the country you want to restrict delivery to into the Add Another Country field, and then click Add on the relevant country. To remove a country from the list, click its remove button. Click Save to save your changes and finish setting up allocation rules. What Is an Allocation Tag? Allocation tags are a type of allocation rule that enables you to filter the list of available carrier services on a per-consignment basis, no matter which allocation endpoint you use in your integration. They are generally used as a flexible means of excluding carrier services that would not be suitable for a particular consignment. Tagged consignments can only be allocated to those carrier services that have a matching tag. You can still allocate untagged shipments to a carrier service that has tags. For example, a retailer might use the UI to add a Flammables tag to all the carrier services that they wanted to use for flammable products. They would then add the Flammables tag to all consignments containing flammable products. PRO would only allocate those consignments tagged as Flammables to a consignment in the pre-approved Flammables list. Configuring Allocation Tags To associate tags with carrier services, use the Settings > Carrier Services > [select carrier service] > Allocation Rules > Allocation Filtering Tags panel of the PRO UI, as detailed in Configuring Allocation Rules . To tag a consignment, add the required tag into the shipment's tags property, either at creation or via the Update Consignment endpoint. The tags property is a simple array listing all the tags that apply to the shipment. The code sample below shows a tags property for a consignment that contains flammable materials, oil and alcohol. Tags \"Tags\": [ \"Flammables\", \"Oil\", \"Alcohol\" ] Tags Example Suppose that you set your carrier services up in the following way: You tag Carrier Service A with Alcohol You tag Carrier Service B with Flammables You tag Carrier Service C with Alcohol and Flammables You tag Carrier Service D with Oil You don't add any tags to Carrier Service E This configuration would produce the following results: Consignment with no tags - A B C D and E are returned Consignment tagged with Alcohol - A and C are returned Consignment tagged with Flammables - B and C are returned Consignment tagged with Alcohol and Flammables - C is returned Consignment tagged with Alcohol , Flammables , and Oil - No services are returned After Allocation Once allocated to a suitable carrier service, the consignment's status changes to Allocated , enabling you to retrieve its package labels and (where applicable) customs documentation. All allocation endpoints also return an Allocation Summary, either singularly or (where multiple consignments have been allocated at once) in an array. The Allocation Summary contains links to the consignment resource that was allocated, a summary of the carrier service that the consignment was allocated to, a link to the relevant package labels, and a ConsignmentLegs array indicating how many legs the shipment will need. Where a shipment would need multiple legs to complete, the ConsignmentLegs array shows tracking details for each individual leg. In the example, a consignment with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MMA has been allocated to a (dummy) carrier service called Carrier X Next Day Super . Allocation Summary Example Allocation Summary [ { \"StatusCode\": 200, \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"detail\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05B-MMA\" }, { \"Rel\": \"label\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/labels/EC-000-05B-MMA\" } ], \"Description\": \"Consignment EC-000-05B-MMA has been successfully allocated with Carrier X Next Day Super for shipping on 14/06/2019 17:00:00 +00:00\", \"ConsignmentLegs\": [ { \"Leg\": 1, \"TrackingReferences\": [ \"TRK00009823\" ], \"CarrierReference\": \"CARRIER_X\", \"CarrierServiceReference\": null, \"CarrierName\": \"Carrier X\" } ], \"CarrierReference\": \"CARRIER_X\", \"CarrierName\": \"Carrier X\", \"CarrierServiceReference\": \"CX_NDS\", \"CarrierServiceName\": \"Next Day Super\" } ] Allocation Section Contents Allocating to a Specific Carrier Service - Explains how to allocate a consignment to a specific carrier service.

This page explains how to allocate consignments to services manually. Getting the Carrier Service Reference In order to allocate a consignment to a specific carrier service, you'll need to know that service's {MpdCarrierServiceReference} . The {MpdCarrierServiceReference} is a unique identifier for each service available in PRO. There are two ways of obtaining a carrier service's {MpdCarrierServiceReference} : Via the UI - The Carrier Services page ( Settings > Carrier Services ) displays a list of all available services. The {MpdCarrierServiceReference} for each service is displayed in the Service Code field. Via API - The Get Available MPD Carrier Services endpoint returns a list of all available services. The {MpdCarrierServiceReference} for each service is displayed in the Reference field. Note For full reference information on the Get Available MPD Carrier Services endpoint, see the Get Available MPD Carrier Services page of the API reference. Allocating to a Carrier Service Manually The Allocate With Carrier Service endpoint enables you to allocate one or more consignments to a specific carrier service. To call Allocate With Carrier Service , make a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/allocatewithcarrierservice . The body of the request should contain the {MpdCarrierServiceReference} of the carrier service you want to allocate to, and an array of consignmentReferences listing the references of the consignments you want to allocate to that service. Note For full reference information on the Allocate With Carrier Service endpoint, see the Allocate With Carrier Service page of the API reference. Once the request is received, SortedPRO takes each consignment in turn and checks whether the specified service is eligible to take that consignment. If the specified service can meet the consignment's delivery promise, and allocating to that service would not break any existing allocation rules, then PRO allocates the consignment to that service and returns an allocation summary. Note For information on using allocation rules, see the What Is An Allocation Rule? section of the Allocating Consignments To Carriers page. If PRO is unable to allocate the consignment to the specified carrier service, it puts the consignment into a state of Allocation Failed and takes no further action. For information on dealing with failed allocations, see the Manage Not Shipped Consignments section of the PRO UI User Manual. Allocate With Carrier Service Example The example shows a request to allocate three consignments to a carrier service with an {MpdCarrierServiceReference} of Example-Carrier-Service . Allocate With Carrier Service Request PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/allocatewithcarrierservice { \"MpdCarrierServiceReference\": \"Example-Carrier-Service\", \"ConsignmentReferences\": [ \"EC-000-05A-Z6S\", \"EC-000-083-45D\", \"EC-000-A04-0DV\" ] } Next Steps Learn about alternative methods of allocating consignments at the Allocating Consignments page.

This page explains how to use the Allocate With Quote endpoint to select a quote. Quotes Overview In PRO, delivery quotes are generally used outside of a \"regular\" consignment allocation workflow, as a means of managing consignments that require manual intervention. For example, your customer service teams might want to get quotes for an expedited delivery on a consignment that was missed by a carrier and so did not meet its delivery promise. PRO's Quotes API enables you to get delivery quotes for both uncreated and existing consignments. All Quotes endpoints return one or more Quote objects, of which each represents an offer for carriage of a consignment with a specific carrier service. Each quote can be uniquely identified by a {quoteReference} , which is used when selecting a quote via the Allocate With Quote endpoint. Note For a full user guide on working with quotes, see the Managing Quotes page. For reference information on the Quotes API, see the API reference . For worked examples showing a consignment being allocated from a quote, see the Quotes call flow page. Using Allocate With Quote The Allocate With Quote endpoint enables you to allocate an individual consignment based on a specific delivery quote from a carrier. To call Allocate With Quote , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/{consignmentReference}/allocatewithquote/{quoteReference} , where {consignmentReference} corresponds to the consignment you want to allocate and {quoteReference} is the quote you want to select. Once the request is received PRO attempts to allocate the consignment to the carrier service specified in the quote (as denoted by the {MpdCarrierService} and MpdCarrierServiceReference fields contained within the Quote object), and returns an Allocation Summary. Note For full reference information on the Allocate With Quote endpoint, see the Allocate With Quote page of the API reference. Allocate With Quote Example The example shows a request to allocate a consignment with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-N40 to the carrier service associated with a quote that has the {quoteReference} 112236d5-4460-492f-a6bd-aa3f00f62dfb . Allocate With Quote Request PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/EC-000-05B-N40/allocatewithquote/112236d5-4460-492f-a6bd-aa3f00f62dfb Next Steps Learn about alternative methods of allocating consignments at the Allocating Consignments page.

Overview The Allocate Using Default Rules and Allocate Consignments endpoints enable you to allocate consignments to the cheapest eligilble carrier service. PRO selects a service for you when you use these endpoints, rather than requiring you to select a service or service group manually. PRO uses the following selection process when allocating via these endpoints: Who can deliver? - First, PRO compiles a list of all carrier services that could potentially take the consignment (that is, configured and enabled services that ship to the delivery address and could meet any specified delivery promise). Who meets the allocation rules? - Next, PRO creates a final shortlist of carrier services by eliminating any services that do not meet your organisation's own allocation rules. For information on using allocation rules, see the What Is An Allocation Rule? section of the Allocating Consignments To Carriers page. Who is cheapest? - Finally, PRO allocates the consignment to the cheapest service on the shortlist. Allocating Multiple Consignments at Once The Allocate Using Default Rules endpoint enables you to allocate multiple consignments to the cheapest eligible carrier service in one request. To call Allocate using Default Rules , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/allocate . The request body should contain an array of one or more {consignmentReference} s to be allocated. Once the request is received, SortedPRO takes each consignment in turn and allocates it to the cheapest eligible carrier, as per the process detailed in the Overview . It then returns an array of Allocation Summaries, one for each allocated consignment. Note For full reference information on the Allocate Using Default Rules endpoint, see the Allocate Using Default Rules page of the API reference. Allocate Using Default Rules Example The example shows a request to allocate three consignments via default rules. Allocate Using Default Rules Request PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/allocate { \"ConsignmentReferences\": [ \"EC-000-05B-MMA\", \"EC-000-083-45D\", \"EC-000-A04-0DV\" ] } Allocating a Single Consignment The Allocate Consignment endpoint allocates a single consignment to the cheapest eligible carrier service. To call Allocate Consignment , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/{consignmentReference}/allocatewithcheapestquote , where {consignmentReference} refers to the consignment you want to allocate. Once the request has been received, SortedPRO uses the process detailed in the Overview to determine the appropriate service and allocate the consignment. It then returns an Allocation Summary. Example The example shows a request to allocate a consignment with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05A-Z6S via the Allocate Consignment endpoint. Allocate Consignment Request PUT https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/EC-000-05A-Z6S/allocatewithcheapestquote Note For full reference information on the Allocate Consignment endpoint, see the Allocate Consignment page of the API reference.

This page explains how to configure service groups, and how to use the Allocate Consignment With Service Group endpoint to allocate from within those groups. What Is a Carrier Service Group? SortedPRO carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used in conjunction with the Allocate Consignment With Service Group endpoint as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular consignment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all consignments involving dangerous items. You can use any combination of carrier services in a carrier service group. Configuring Carrier Service Groups You will need to configure carrier service groups in the PRO UI. To add a carrier service groups: Log in to the PRO UI and open the Carrier Service Groups page ( Settings > Carrier Service Groups ) to display a list of existing carrier service groups. Click Add Service Group to display the Add Carrier Service Group page. Enter a Name for the new service group. This is used as an identifier for the group within the PRO UI. Enter a Service Group Code for the new service group. This is used as an identifier for the group when selecting it via the Allocate Consignment With Service Group endpoint (referred to as the {mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference} in the reference documentation). Select the services you want to add to the group by clicking on them in the service list. If required, you can filter the list of services by clicking Filter and entering data into the filter fields displayed. All fields are optional. Click Save to save the group. A new tile is added for the group on the Carrier Service Groups page, and you can now use the group when calling the Allocate Consignment With Service Group endpoint. To edit an existing carrier service group, click its Edit link. To delete an existing carrier service group, click its Delete This Group link. Using the Allocate With Service Group Endpoint To call Allocate Consignment With Service Group , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/allocation/{consignmentReference}/allocatewithservicegroup/{mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference} , where {consignmentReference} is the unique reference for the consignment you want to allocate and {mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference} is the Service Group Code of the group you want to allocate within. Note For full reference information on the Allocate Consignment With Service Group endpoint, see the Allocate Consignment With Service Group page of the API reference. To find the Service Group Code for a particular group, log in to the PRO UI, navigate to the Carrier Service Groups page ( Settings > Carrier Service Groups ), and locate the tile for that group. The Service Group Code is shown in the Code field. Once the request is received, PRO uses allocation rules to eliminate any carrier services in the group that would not be suitable to take the consignment, allocates the consignment to the cheapest remaining service, and returns an Allocation Summary. Note For information on using allocation rules, see the What Is An Allocation Rule? section of the Allocating Consignments To Carriers page. Allocate Consignment With Service Group Example The example shows a request to allocate a consignment with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MMA within a group that has a {mpdCarrierServiceGroupReference} of valuableGoods .

Overview You can only cancel a consignment prior to it being manifested. Once a consignment has been manifested it can no longer be cancelled. Once a consignment has been cancelled, then no further changes can be made to it. If you want to reinstate a cancelled consignment then you will need to create a new consignment with the same details. Cancelling Individual Consignments To cancel an individual consignment, use the Cancel Consignment endpoint. You can call Cancel Consignment by sending a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{consignmentReference}/cancel . Once the request has been received, PRO changes the consignment's ConsignmentState to Cancelled and returns a code 200 response with no body. Note For full reference information on the Cancel Consignment endpoint, see the API reference . Cancelling Consignments in Bulk If you need to cancel multiple consignments in one operation, use the Cancel Consignments endpoint. You can call Cancel Consignments by sending a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/cancellist . The body of the request should comprise an array listing the consignmentReference s of the consignments you want to cancel. Once the request has been received, PRO changes the each consignment's consignmentState to Cancelled and returns a list with a confirmation message in it for each consignment. Note For full reference information on the Cancel Consignments endpoint, see the API reference . Cancel Consignments Example This example shows three consignments being cancelled at once via Cancel Consignments endpoint. Cancel Consignments Request Cancel Consignments Response PUT https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/cancellist [ \"EC-000-05D-1NS\", \"EC-000-05D-1NT\", \"EC-000-05D-1NV\" ] [ { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment cancellation completed successfully\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-05D-1NS\", \"ApiLinks\": null }, { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment cancellation completed successfully\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-05D-1NT\", \"ApiLinks\": null }, { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment cancellation completed successfully\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-05D-1NV\", \"ApiLinks\": null } ] Next Steps Learn how to allocate consignments at the Allocating Consignments to Carriers page.

This page explains the various ways that you can record consignment information in PRO. Creating a Consignment Via the Consignments API Perhaps the simplest way to record consignment details in PRO is to use the Create Consignment API endpoint. Create Consignment enables you to send consignment details directly to PRO, from which PRO creates the consignment record and returns a unique {consignmentReference} . Sending the Request To create a consignment, send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments . The body of the request should contain the consignment details, structured as per the PRO data contract. Note For full reference information on the Create Consignments endpoint, including the properties accepted and the structure required, see the Create Consignment API reference . As a minimum, the Create Consignments endpoint requires you to send package weights and dimensions, origin address, and destination address data. You can either specify package weights and dimension via the Weight and Dimensions properties, or by supplying a PackageSizeReference . Note A PackageSizeReference is a unique identifier for a pre-defined, standardised package size. To configure standard package sizes, use the Configuration > Packaging Sizes page of the PRO UI. You can also view a list of your available standard package sizes by making a call to the Get Package Sizes API. Either the consignment's destination address, its origin address (if it has one), or both, must include a valid ShippingLocationReference . For information on how to obtain a list of your organisation's shipping locations, see the Get Shipping Locations page of the API reference. There are lots of optional properties you can send when creating a consignment, including: Your own consignment reference. Details of the specific items inside the consignment's packages. The consignment's source. Shipping and delivery dates. The consignment's direction of travel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to use custom fields to record additional data about a consignment. For more information on using metadata in PRO, see the Metadata page. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular consignment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Tags page. Adding optional properties when you create a consignment can help you to get more out of PRO. For example, recording your own consignment reference enables you to search for consignments by those references in the UI and via the Search Consignments endpoint. Caution You should exercise caution when using the ShippingDate and RequiredDeliveryDate parameters to specify dates for your consignment. These parameters limit delivery options for the consignment, meaning that the consignment can only be allocated to carrier services that would be able to ship it on the specified ShippingDate and / or deliver it by the RequiredDeliveryDate . If the IsToBeExactlyOnTheDateSpecified flag of the RequiredDeliveryDate is set, then the consignment is further limited, as it can only be allocated to a service that would deliver it on the exact date specified. If the dates you specify are too restrictive, there may not be any carrier services available to take the consignment, which would result in a failed allocation. As such, you should only specify shipping and delivery dates where it is necessary to do so. International Shipments Following the UK's departure from the EU, certain additional consignment properties must be passed in order for PRO to generate customs documentation for UK-originating international consignments. In addition, certain carriers have their own data requirements that UK-originating international consignments must meet in order to be considered for allocation to that carrier. For an explanation of Brexit-related data requirements, see the Brexit Data Guide page. For more information on commercial invoices and other customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Customs Docs and Invoices page. Example Create Consignments Request The example below shows a simple Create Consignments request containing just package and address details. For an example of a full Create Consignment request, see the Create Consignment API reference. Create Consignments Request POST https://api.electioapp.com/consignments { \"Packages\": [ { \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.5, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.0, \"Length\": 10.0, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Description\": \"Socks\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } } } ], \"Addresses\": [ { \"AddressType\": \"Origin\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"Sorted1\", \"IsCached\": false }, { \"AddressType\": \"Destination\", \"Contact\": { \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"Great Britain\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"IsCached\": false } ] } The Create Consignments Response Once it has received the consignment information, PRO creates the consignment record and returns a link to the newly-created consignment, including its {consignmentReference} . The {consignmentReference} is a unique identifier for that consignment within PRO, and is a required parameter for many of PRO's API requests. Each PRO {consignmentReference} takes the format EC-xxx-xxx-xxx , where x is an alphanumeric character. Many of PRO's endpoints take {consignmentReference} as a parameter. In the example below, PRO has returned a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MMA . Create Consignments Response [ { \"Rel\": \"Link\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05B-MMA\" } ] All PRO consignments have a {consignmentState} , indicating the point in the delivery process that that particular consignment is at. Newly-created consignments have an initial state of Unallocated . For more information on PRO consignment states, see the Consignment States page. Note You can also create consignments via the Manual Upload page of the PRO UI. This feature is effectively a front-end for the Create Consignments API, and is most useful for handling exceptions and cases in which your conventional API workflow cannot be used. For more information on creating consignments via the PRO UI, see the Create a Consignment Manually how-to procedure in the PRO Web Admin Portal User Guide. Creating Consignments From Delivery Options The Create Consignments endpoint isn't the only PRO endpoint that can generate consignments. You can also create consignments via the Delivery Options API, which enables you to get a list of delivery options for a potential consignment that you can present to your customer at checkout. When you select the required option, PRO automatically creates and allocates a new consignment without requiring you to make additional API calls. Note Access to PRO's delivery and pickup option endpoints requires a SortedHERO license. This component is sold separately to the main SortedPRO product. To create a consignment in this way, you'll need to make two API calls: Call the Delivery Options endpoint. The structure of the Delivery Options request is very similar to that of the Create Consignment request. However, rather than simply creating a consignment from the information, PRO instead returns a list of potential delivery options for the (as yet uncreated) consignment. Each delivery option represents a delivery date and time, and a carrier services that can fulfil the delivery of the consignment in line with that date and time. To select the option that the customer chooses, send the relevant deliveryOptionReference to PRO via the Select Option endpoint. PRO uses the information that you provided when making the Delivery Options request to create a new consignment and allocate it to the relevant carrier service for the selected delivery option. It then returns a link to the created consignment. You can also generate consignments from pickup options. The process is the same as that used for delivery options - make a Pickup Options call and then select the required option via the Select Option endpoint. Note For a full user guide on working with delivery and pickup options, including further information on selecting options, see the Using Delivery and Pickup Options section. For reference information on the Delivery Options and Pickup Options APIs, see the API reference . Creating Consignments From Orders You can also create consignments from orders via the Pack Order endpoint. Pack Order enables you to take a PRO order and generate consignments from it. This function is particularly useful if your business uses multiple fulfilment centres, or uses drop ship vendors. It's important to understand the difference between a consignment and an order when using Pack Order : An order is a collection of items that is to be transported to the same destination on behalf of the same customer. A consignment is a collection of packages that is to be transported to the same destination, on behalf of the same customer, from the same origin, on the same day, and using the same carrier service . The Pack Order endpoint enables you to take those items on an order that share an origin and are to be shipped together, and generate a shippable consignment from them. You will need to send one Pack Order request per consignment that you want to create from the order. To create a consignment in this way, you'll need to make two API calls: Call the Create Order endpoint to create an order in PRO. The structure of the Create Order request is very similar to that of the Create Consignment request, and must include package, origin address, and destination address data at a minimum. PRO creates the order and returns an orderReference . Call the Pack Order endpoint to create a consignment. In the body of the request you'll need to supply at least the relevant orderReference and the package details of the consignment that you want to pack. Each package must contain at least one item, and only items supplied on the original order can be packed. If the Pack Order request is successful, PRO creates a consignment and returns the consignment reference. Note For a full user guide on working with orders, see the Creating New Orders and Managing Existing Orders page. For reference information on the Orders API, see the API reference .

This page explains the various ways in which you can create orders. Creating Orders Directly The Create Order endpoint enables you to record details of a customer's order in SortedPRO. To call Create Order , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/orders . The body structure of the Create Order request is very similar to that of the Create Consignments request, with the exception that items on an order do not need to share an origin, ship date, and carrier. Note For more information on the difference between orders and consignments, see the Managing Orders page. At a minimum, the Create Order endpoint requires you to send item, origin address, and destination address data. However, there are lots of other properties you can send when creating an order, including: Your own order reference. The order's source. The required delivery date. Customs documentation. The order's direction of travel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to record additional data about a consignment in custom fields. For more information on using metadata in PRO, see the Metadata page. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular consignment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Tags page. Either the order's origin address, its destination address, or both, must include a valid ShippingLocationReference . For information on how to obtain a list of your organisation's shipping locations, see the Get Shipping Locations page of the API reference. Note For full reference information on the Create Order endpoint, see the Create Order page of the API reference. For an example call flow showing orders being created, see the Order Flex call flow page. Adding an EORI Number If required, you can record a order's EORI number using the Metadata property. To do so, add a property with a KeyValue of ShippersEORI and a StringValue representing the number itself. EORI Number Example { \"OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"YOUR-REF\", \"Addresses\": [ // addresses ], \"Packages\": [ // package properties ], \"Metadata\": [ { \"KeyValue\": \"ShippersEORI\", \"StringValue\": \"GB987654312000\" } ] // other order properties } If you add a ShippersEORI metadata property to an international order, then PRO automatically adds that property to any consignments that are packed from that order. PRO also automatically adds an EORI Number field to any commercial invoices that it generates from those consignments. Note For more information on commercial invoices and other customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Customs Docs and Invoices page. For more information on packing orders, see the Creating Consignments From Orders Create Order Example The example shows the creation of a fairly standard order. In this case, we have an outbound order comprising a single package with a single item inside it. After receiving the request, PRO returns an {orderReference} of EO-000-002-0TS . You will need the {orderReference} when you come to pack the order into shippable consignments. Create Order Request Create Order Response POST https://api.electioapp.com/orders { \"Packages\": [ { \"Items\": [ { \"Sku\": \"SKU093434\", \"Description\": \"Striped Bamboo Red/White\", \"CountryOfOrigin\": { \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.5, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.0, \"Length\": 10.0, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } } } ], \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.5, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.0, \"Length\": 10.0, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Description\": \"Socks\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } } } ], \"Addresses\": [ { \"AddressType\": \"Origin\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"Sorted1\", \"IsCached\": false }, { \"AddressType\": \"Destination\", \"Contact\": { \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"Great Britain\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"IsCached\": false } ] } [ { \"Rel\": \"Order\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/orders/EO-000-002-0TS\" } ] Creating Orders From Delivery Options The Create Orders endpoint isn't the only PRO endpoint that can generate orders. You can also create orders via the Delivery Options API, which enables you to get a list of delivery options for a potential order that you can present to your customer at checkout. When you select the required option as an order, PRO automatically creates a new order without requiring you to make additional API calls. Creating orders in this way lets you provide front-end delivery options in circumstances where you cannot guarantee that the contents of your customer's online basket will map directly to a single consignment (and so first need to create an order that you can pack into consignments). For example, you might operate more than one warehouse and so may need to ship some orders in multiple consignments. Note Access to PRO's delivery and pickup option endpoints requires a SortedHERO license. This component is sold separately to the main SortedPRO product. To create an order from delivery options, you'll need to make two API calls: Call the Delivery Options endpoint. The structure of the Delivery Options request is very similar to that of the Create Order request. However, rather than simply creating an order from the information, PRO instead returns a list of potential delivery options for the (as yet uncreated) order. Each delivery option represents a delivery date and time, and a suitable carrier service. Select the option that the customer chooses as an order. To do so, call Select Delivery Option As An Order by sending a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/selectorder with the Reference of the delivery option you want to select in the body of the request. You can also generate orders from pickup options. The process is the same as that used for delivery options - make a Pickup Options call and then select the required option via the Select Delivery Option As Order endpoint.

This page explains how to deallocate consignments from their carrier services both individually and in bulk. Overview A consignment cannot be edited once it is allocated. In order to edit or cancel an allocated consignment, or to allocate it to a different carrier service, you will first need to deallocate it. Note For more information on editing existing consignments, see the Updating Existing Consignments page. Deallocating a consignment erases any allocation data that consignment holds and changes its state to Unallocated . You can only deallocate consignments that are in a state of Allocated , Manifested , or Manifest Failed . Deallocating Individual Consignments The Deallocate Consignment endpoint enables you to deallocate a single consignment. To call Deallocate Consignment , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{consignmentReference}/deallocate , where {consignmentReference} corresponds to the consignment that you want to deallocate. Once the request is received, PRO deallocates the consignment and returns a code 200 response with no body. Deallocate Multiple Consignments The Deallocate Consignments endpoint enables you to deallocate multiple consignments in a single operation. To call Deallocate Consignments , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/deallocatelist . The body of the request should contain an array listing the {consignmentReference} s of the consignments that you want to deallocate.

This guide explains some common use cases for PRO's APIs, helping you to see what PRO can do for your business. We will cover: Creating and manifesting a consignment The Classic flow is a simple flow to create a consignment, allocate it to a carrier service using criteria of your choosing, retrieve delivery labels, and confirm the delivery with the carrier. Offering and using delivery options The Consumer Options flow is used when you want to present delivery options to your customer at point of purchase. PRO creates and allocates consignments based on the options the customer selects. Offering and using pickup options The Consumer Options Pickup flow is similar to the Consumer Options flow, but used when offering delivery to a pickup/drop-off (PUDO) location rather than home delivery. Creating a pack order flow from a PRO order The Order Flex flow is used when you can't guarantee that all parts of a customer's order will be picked, packed and dispatched from the same place at the same time. PRO can generate multiple consignments from a single customer order where required. Obtaining and selecting delivery quotes The Quotes flow is used to obtain a full list of potential delivery services for a consignment. It is often used to validate a consignment's detail or to enable a customer service operator to get manual quotes for a customer. Note This guide is intended as a primer for PRO. If you're already familiar with the basics of PRO, or you just need reference info for PRO's APIs, see the API Reference . All of the URLs and examples given in this documentation relate to PRO's live production environment. To call APIs in the sandbox environment, substitute the api.electioapp.com portion of the API's base URL with apisandbox.electioapp.com . Don't forget to use your sandbox API key (as opposed to your production API key) when making the call. For more information on PRO's sandbox, see Using the Sandbox Environment ."

The Classic call flow offers the lightest integration design of all PRO flows, making it easy for your organisation to manage deliveries across multiple carriers. The Classic flow is most useful to your business if: You have a single warehouse / fulfilment centre. You use a static delivery promise (e.g. Next day delivery before 5pm). You want to keep your business logic and technology architecture as simple as possible. There are four steps to the flow: Create the consignment - Use the Create Consignment endpoint to record the details of your new consignment. Allocate the consignment - Use one of PRO's Allocation endpoints to select the carrier service that your consignment will use. You can nominate a specific service, ask PRO to determine the best service to use from a pre-defined group, or allocate based on pre-set allocation rules. Get the consignment's labels - Use the Get Labels in Format endpoint to get the delivery label for your consignment. Manifest the consignment - Use the Manifest Consignments from Query endpoint to send consignment data to the selected carrier. This section gives more detail on each step of the flow and provides worked examples. Step 1: Creating Consignments [!include[_create_consignments](../../includes/_create_consignments.md)] Step 2: Allocating Consignments [!include[_allocating](../../includes/_allocating.md)] Allocating using Default Rules [!include[_allocate_using_default_rules](../../includes/_allocate_using_default_rules.md)] Allocating from a Service Group [!include[_allocate_with_service_group](../../includes/_allocate_with_service_group.md)] Allocating to a Specific Carrier Service [!include[_allocate_with_carrier_service](../../includes/_allocate_with_carrier_service.md)] Step 3: Getting Package Labels [!include[_get_labels_in_format](../../includes/_get_labels_in_format.md)] Step 3b (Optional): Getting Customs Docs [!include[_get_customs_docs](../../includes/_get_customs_docs.md)] Step 4: Manifesting a Consignment [!include[_manifest_consignments_from_query](../../includes/_manifest_consignments_from_query.md)] Next Steps And we're done!

However, rather than generating a single consignment from the options selected, this flow generates orders, which can then be packed into multiple consignments. The Consumer Options Flex flow can be used to provide front-end delivery options in circumstances where you cannot guarantee that the contents of your customer's online basket will map directly to a single consignment. For example, you might operate more than one warehouse and so may need to ship some orders in multiple consignments. The Consumer Options Flex flow is useful to your business if: You use a distributed business logic and technology architecture. You operate multiple warehouses / fulfilment centres. You want to present your customer with a dynamic checkout that offers delivery timeslot options. There are six steps to the flow: Get delivery options - Use the Delivery Options endpoint to request a list of available delivery options for the (as yet uncreated) consignment that the customer's purchase will generate. Select option as an order - Use the Select Delivery Option as an Order to generate an order from the selected delivery option. Pack the order - Use the Pack Order endpoint to create one or more consignments from the order. Allocate the consignments - Use one of PRO's Allocation endpoints to select the carrier service that your consignments will use. You can select a specific service, ask PRO to determine the best service to use from a pre-defined group of services, or allocate based on pre-set allocation rules. Get the consignment's labels - Use the Get Labels in Format endpoint to get the delivery label for your consignment. Manifest the consignments - Use the Manifest Consignments from Query endpoint to confirm the consignment with the selected carrier. At this point, the consignment is ready to ship. This section gives more detail on each step of the flow and provides worked examples. Step 1: Getting Options [!include[_getting_delivery_options](../../includes/_getting_delivery_options.md)] Note Although this guide focuses on generating an order from the Delivery Options endpoint, you can also generate orders from pickup options via the Pickup Options endpoint. For more information on the Pickup Options endpoint, see the Pickup Options page of the API reference. Step 2: Selecting an Option as an Order [!include[_select_option_as_order](../../includes/_select_option_as_order.md)] Step 3: Packing the Order [!include[_pack_orders](../../includes/_pack_orders.md)] Step 4: Allocating the Consignment [!include[_allocating](../../includes/_allocating.md)] You'll need to allocate all of the consignments packed from your order. Bear in mind that Allocate using Default Rules and Allocate with Carrier Service enable you to allocate multiple consignments at once, but you can only allocate one consignment at a time via Allocate Consignment with Service Group . If you allocate via Allocate Consignment with Service Group you'll need to make one API call per consignment on the order.

This page explains how to fetch data on an individual consignment, and how to search for consignments that meet a particular set of criteria. Getting Data For a Specific Consignment Perhaps the most straightforward way of getting PRO consignment data is to use the Get Consignment endpoint. This endpoint takes the consignmentReference of the consignment you want to view as a path parameter, and returns full details for the specified consignment. The information returned is structured in a broadly similar way to a Create Consignment request, but can also (where applicable) include additional information, including: Information on the carrier service the consignment is allocated to Tracking references for each of the consignment's packages Information on the number of shipment legs required to deliver the consignment Label information, including whether labels have been printed yet and the date on which the labels were printed An IsLate flag indicating whether the consignment is late or not. To call Get Consignment , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{consignmentReference} . Note For full reference information on the Get Consignment endpoint, see the API reference . Example Get Consignment Call The example below shows a simple Get Consignment request for an unallocated consignment containing just package and address details. For an example of a full Get Consignment request, see the Get Consignment API reference. Get Consignment Request Get Consignment Response GET https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05C-ZB4 { \"ConsignmentLegs\": [], \"CollectionDate\": null, \"DateDelivered\": null, \"FirstAttemptedDeliveryDate\": null, \"DateReturned\": null, \"DateShipped\": null, \"DateCollected\": null, \"AttemptedDeliveryDate\": null, \"MetaData\": [], \"Allocation\": null, \"FailedAllocation\": null, \"Source\": \"Api\", \"LabelCount\": 0, \"LabelsPrinted\": false, \"DateLabelsWereFirstPrinted\": null, \"IsLate\": false, \"LateForCustomer\": false, \"CustomerReference\": \"338a3524-5a17-44dd-a601-1527574f1a5d\", \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.50000, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"CustomsDocumentation\": null, \"Direction\": \"Outbound\", \"Tags\": [], \"Reference\": \"EC-000-05C-ZB4\", \"ConsignmentState\": \"Unallocated\", \"DateCreated\": \"2020-02-10T11:21:07.8156519+00:00\", \"ShippingDate\": null, \"RequestedDeliveryDate\": null, \"EarliestDeliveryDate\": null, \"LatestDeliveryDate\": null, \"ConsignmentReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"\", \"Addresses\": [ { \"AddressType\": \"Origin\", \"ShopLocationReference\": null, \"Contact\": { \"Reference\": null, \"Title\": \"Miss\", \"FirstName\": \"Laura\", \"LastName\": \"Somebody\", \"Position\": null, \"Telephone\": \"01234 567 890\", \"Mobile\": \"01234 567 890\", \"LandLine\": \"\", \"Email\": \"laura.somebody@mpd-group.com\" }, \"CompanyName\": null, \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"Sorted1\", \"CustomerName\": null, \"AddressLine1\": \"Third Floor\", \"AddressLine2\": \"Merchant Exchange\", \"AddressLine3\": \"Whitworth Street West\", \"Town\": \"Manchester\", \"Region\": \"\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"RegionCode\": \"\", \"SpecialInstructions\": \"\", \"LatLong\": null, \"IsCached\": false }, { \"AddressType\": \"Destination\", \"ShopLocationReference\": null, \"Contact\": { \"Reference\": null, \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Position\": null, \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"CompanyName\": null, \"ShippingLocationReference\": null, \"CustomerName\": null, \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"AddressLine2\": null, \"AddressLine3\": null, \"Town\": null, \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"RegionCode\": \"\", \"SpecialInstructions\": null, \"LatLong\": null, \"IsCached\": false } ], \"Packages\": [ { \"ConsignmentLegs\": [], \"Items\": [], \"Charges\": [], \"Reference\": \"EP-000-05E-YRQ\", \"PackageReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"\", \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.50000, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.00000, \"Length\": 10.00000, \"Height\": 10.00000 }, \"Description\": \"Socks\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.9900, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"PackageSizeReference\": null, \"Barcode\": null, \"MetaData\": [] } ] } Checking a Consignment's Status If you only need to check a consignment's status, you could use the Get Consignment Status endpoint instead of Get Consignment . Get Consignment Status takes a consignmentReference as a path parameter, and returns only the consignment's current status and expected delivery date. Although Get Consignment returns both status and delivery date, it also returns a great deal of other information, which may not be useful if you simply want to check a consignment's progress. To make a Get Consignment Status request, send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{consignmentReference}/status . Get Consignment Status Request Get Consignment Status Response GET https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-087-01A/status { \"ConsignmentReferenceForAllLegsAssignedByMpd\": \"EC-000-087-01A\", \"Status\": \"Allocated\", \"ExpectedDeliveryDate\": \"2020-06-02T14:20:11.4370803+01:00\", \"ApiLink\": { \"Rel\": \"Link\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-087-01A\" } } Searching For Consignments As well as endpoints that return data based on a consignmentReference , PRO also enables you to search for consignments that meet a particular set of criteria. PRO has two search endpoints: Get Consignments References and Search Consignments . Both of these endpoints enable you to specify consignment parameters in your request, and return any consignments that meet those parameters. The two search endpoints differ in their responses: Get Consignments References returns only the consignmentReference s of any consignments that meet the criteria, while Search Consignments returns a summary of each matching consignment. Search Consignments also includes a paging feature that enables you to specify how many results you want PRO to return, and to skip over a specified number of results. Using Get Consignments References To call Get Consignments References , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/getConsignmentReferences?{property}={value} , where {property} is the name of the consignment property you want to search on and {value} is its associated value. You can separate additional properties using the & operator. PRO then returns the consignmentReferences of any consignments that meet all the criteria that you specify. Note For a full list of search properties accepted by the Get Consignments References endpoint, see the API reference Get Consignments References Example The example below shows a request for all inbound consignments in an Allocated state. PRO has returned two consignments. Get Consignments References Request Get Consignments References Response https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/getConsignmentReferences?State=Allocated&Direction=Inbound [ \"EC-000-05C-VQ4\", \"EC-000-05C-VQ3\" ] Using Search Consignments To call Search Consignments , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{take}/{skip}?{property}={value} , where: {take} is the maximum number of results you want the endpoint to return {skip} is the number of results in the list that you want to skip {property} is the name of the consignment property you want to search on {value} is the property value you want to search on. As with the Get Consignments References API, you can add additional search properties and values, as long as each property/value pair is separated by an & operator. Note The {take} and {skip} values can be used to drive paging functions in systems that present a list of consignments to the user. For example, suppose that you have 100 active consignments in an Allocated state. A call to GET https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/100/0?&State=Allocated would return all of those consignments, as a {take} value of 100 and a {skip} value of 0 means that the API will return up to 100 results without skipping over any. However, suppose that you want to split the list up into two groups of 50 (for example, because you are using the data to populate a list in a system whose UI only enables you to display 50 results at any one time). In this case, you would populate the first page of results with a call to GET https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/50/0?&State=Allocated (max. 50 results, none skipped). If the user elects to view the second page, you would call GET https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/50/50?&State=Allocated . The API would again return 50 results, but would skip over the first 50 in the list (i.e. those results that were displayed on the first page) and instead return results 51-100. The Search Consignments endpoint returns a summary of each consignment that meets the request criteria. The summary object contains the following: The carrier service that the consignment is allocated to (where applicable) and its date of allocation Address information Requested and estimated delivery dates, and a flag indicating whether the shipment is late The consignment's label status (i.e. whether labels have been printed and on what date) The consignment reference The customer's reference for the consignment (where applicable) Creation and shipping dates The consignment's value and weight Note For full reference information on the Search Consignments endpoint, see the API reference . Search Consignments Example The example below shows a request for all inbound consignments in an Allocated state, with a potential maximum of 100 results returned and none skipped. PRO has returned a summary of two consignments.

Customs Docs in PRO When shipping internationally, SortedPRO will automatically determine if customs documentation is required for a consignment. SortedPRO can automatically generate CN22, CN23, or Commercial Invoice documents in PDF format and will determine which document is appropriate for any allocated consignment. The Customs Docs APIs enable you to retrieve the pre-generated documents. Note Following the UK's departure from the EU, certain additional consignment properties must be passed in order for PRO to generate customs documentation for UK-originating international consignments. In addition, certain carriers have their own data requirements that UK-originating international consignments must meet in order to be considered for allocation to that carrier. For an explanation of Brexit-related data requirements, see the Brexit Data Guide page. The Customs Docs API has three endpoints: Get Commercial Invoice - returns a consignment's commercial invoice. Get Customs Document - returns a CN22 or CN23 document for a particular package. Get Customs Documents - returns all customs documents for a particular consignment. Caution You can only retrieve documents for consignments that have been allocated to a carrier. If you attempt to return labels for an unallocated consignment, PRO returns an error. Getting Commercial Invoices To call Get Commercial Invoice , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/docs/commercialinvoice/{consignmentReference} . PRO returns the commercial invoice for the relevant consignment as a base-64 encoded byte array. Note For full reference information on the Get Commercial Invoice endpoint, see the API reference . Getting an Individual Customs Document To call Get Customs Document , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/docs/{customsDocumentType}/{consignmentReference}/{packageReference} . The {customsDocumentType} can return either CN22 or CN23 documents. PRO returns the relevant document as a base-64 encoded byte array. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Document endpoint, see the API reference . Getting All Customs Documents for a Consignment To call Get Customs Documents , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/docs/{consignmentReference} . PRO returns an object containing two properties: a CommercialInvoiceDocuments property containing the consignment's commercial invoice and either a CN22Documents property containing all CN22 documents for the consignment or a CN23Documents property containing all CN23 documents for the consignment. All documents are represented as key / value pairs, with the key as the filename for the document and the value containing the document data. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Documents endpoint, see the API reference . Get Customs Documents Example This example shows a Get Customs Documents response for a single-package consignment. PRO has returned a commercial invoice for the consignment and a CN22 document for the package. Get Customs Documents Response { \"CommercialInvoiceDocuments\": [ { \"Key\": \"INV_Example\", \"Value\": \"(document data)\" } ], \"CN22Documents\": [ { \"Key\": \"CN22_Example\", \"Value\": \"(document data)\" } ] } Note Once you have downloaded the file data, you will need to decode the file's Base64 in order to view the document itself. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Next Steps Learn how to get and print delivery labels at the Getting Labels page.

Getting Detailed Options The Delivery Options endpoint takes the details of an as-yet-nonexistent consignment and returns a list of delivery options. To call Delivery Options , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions . Note For further information on what constitutes a delivery option, see the Using Delivery and Pickup Options page. At a minimum, PRO requires you to send the consignment's package, origin address and destination address data in your Delivery Options request. However, there are lots of other properties you can send when getting delivery options, including: Your own consignment reference. The consignment's source. Shipping and delivery dates. Customs documentation. The consignment's direction of travel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to record additional data about a consignment in custom fields. For more information on using metadata in PRO, see the Metadata page. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular consignment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Tags page. Providing extra information can help you to improve the relevance of the options returned, and means that any consignments or orders you generate from an option will be populated with richer data. Either the consignment's origin address, its destination address, or both, must include a valid ShippingLocationReference . For information on how to obtain a list of your organisation's shipping locations, see the Get Shipping Locations page of the API reference. Once it has received the request, PRO returns an array of {DeliveryOptions} objects. Each {DeliveryOptions} object contains details of a particular delivery option that is available to take a consignment with the details you passed in the request, including: Reference - A unique identifier for the delivery option, used when selecting delivery options in the next step. Dates and Delivery Windows Carrier Service Price (cost) Allocation Cutoff - The option's expiry time. If the option is not used by this time, it is rendered invalid. This value is usually set by the carrier, but can be configured manually via the Settings > Shipping Locations > [Select Location] > Collection Calendar page of the PRO UI. Operational Cutoff - The operational cut off date as specified by the fulfilling shipping location. Service Direction PRO only returns a single carrier service for each delivery window on each date. This is generally the cheapest service, unless using the cheapest service would conflict with existing business rules. Note For full reference information on the Delivery Options endpoint, see the Delivery Options page of the API reference. Get Delivery Options Example The example shows a request to get delivery options for a fairly standard consignment. The API has returned two delivery options, both for Carrier X: one with an {estimatedDeliveryDate} of 2020-03-18 and one with an {estimatedDeliveryDate} of 2020-03-19 . Get Delivery Options Request Get Delivery Options Response POST https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions { \"Packages\": [ { \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.5, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.0, \"Length\": 10.0, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Description\": \"Socks\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } } } ], \"Addresses\": [ { \"AddressType\": \"Origin\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"Sorted1\", \"IsCached\": false }, { \"AddressType\": \"Destination\", \"Contact\": { \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"Great Britain\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"IsCached\": false } ] } { \"DeliveryOptions\": [ { \"Reference\": \"EDO-000-79G-RXC\", \"EstimatedDeliveryDate\": { \"Date\": \"2020-03-18T00:00:00+00:00\", \"Guaranteed\": true, \"DayOfWeek\": \"Wednesday\" }, \"DeliveryWindow\": { \"Start\": \"00:00:00\", \"End\": \"23:59:00\", \"UtcOffset\": \"+00:00\" }, \"Carrier\": \"Carrier X\", \"CarrierService\": \"Tracked 48 \", \"CarrierServiceReference\": \"MPD_RMDTPS48HNAUT\", \"CarrierServiceTypes\": [ \"Standard\" ], \"Price\": { \"Net\": 27.69, \"Gross\": 33.23, \"TaxRate\": { \"Reference\": \"GB-0.2000\", \"CountryIsoCode\": \"GB\", \"Type\": \"Standard\", \"Rate\": 0.2000 }, \"VatAmount\": 5.54, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"AllocationCutOff\": \"2020-03-14T00:00:00+00:00\", \"OperationalCutOff\": \"2020-03-14T00:00:00+00:00\", \"ServiceDirection\": \"Inbound, Outbound\" }, { \"Reference\": \"EDO-000-79G-RXD\", \"EstimatedDeliveryDate\": { \"Date\": \"2020-03-19T00:00:00+00:00\", \"Guaranteed\": true, \"DayOfWeek\": \"Thursday\" }, \"DeliveryWindow\": { \"Start\": \"00:00:00\", \"End\": \"23:59:00\", \"UtcOffset\": \"+00:00\" }, \"Carrier\": \"Carrier X\", \"CarrierService\": \"Tracked 48 \", \"CarrierServiceReference\": \"MPD_RMDTPS48HNAUT\", \"CarrierServiceTypes\": [ \"Standard\" ], \"Price\": { \"Net\": 27.69, \"Gross\": 33.23, \"TaxRate\": { \"Reference\": \"GB-0.2000\", \"CountryIsoCode\": \"GB\", \"Type\": \"Standard\", \"Rate\": 0.2000 }, \"VatAmount\": 5.54, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"AllocationCutOff\": \"2020-03-16T00:00:00+00:00\", \"OperationalCutOff\": \"2020-03-16T00:00:00+00:00\", \"ServiceDirection\": \"Inbound, Outbound\" } ] } Both of these options have a time window starting at 00:00 and ending at 23:59. In practice, the carrier is offering to make the delivery at some point on either the 18th or 19th of March (as selected by the customer), but isn't offering a more specific timeslot on that service. Note the {Reference} for each delivery option. When the customer selects their preferred delivery option you will need to pass the relevant {Reference} back to PRO via the Select Option endpoint. At this point, you would present some or all of the options returned to your customer via your site or app. For information on how to handle the choice the customer makes, see the Selecting Options page. Getting a Summary of Options The Delivery Options Summary endpoint enables you to to get a list of all dates on which delivery and/or pickup options would be available for a particular consignment. This could be useful during checkout flows if you want to give your customers an indication of the dates on which they could request delivery before you make a full Get Delivery Options call To call Delivery Options Summary , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/summary . The body of the request should contain the details of an as-yet uncreated consignment, structured identically to a Get Delivery Options request. For more information on the structure of a Get Delivery Options request, see the Getting Detailed Options section. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a list of all dates that have DeliveryOptions and TimeSlots available for that consignment, and a separate list with all dates that have PickUp options available for that consignment. Note that PRO does not return details of the delivery options themselves. Note For full reference information on the Delivery Options Summary endpoint, see the Delivery Options Summary page of the API reference. Delivery Options Summary Example In this example response, PRO has returned a list of delivery dates, but there are no available pickup options for the consignment. Delivery Options Summary Response { \"Reference\": \"EPC-000-039-EPK\", \"DeliveryOptions\": [ \"2020-03-18T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-19T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-20T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-21T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-23T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-24T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-25T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-26T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-27T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-28T00:00:00\", \"2020-03-30T00:00:00\" ], \"TimeSlots\": null, \"PickUp\": null, \"DropOff\": null } Getting Existing Delivery Options The Get Existing Delivery Option endpoint enables you to get the details of an existing delivery option (that is, a delivery option that was generated by a previous Get Delivery Options call) using that delivery option's {deliveryOptionReference} . To call Get Existing Delivery Option , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/details/{deliveryOptionReference} . There is no body content required for the request. Once it has received the request, PRO returns the details of the delivery option as a deliveryOption object. For further information on the structure of delivery options, see the Getting Detailed Options section.

This page explains how to get labels for a specific consignment or an individual package within a consignment. The Labels Request Getting labels is a key part of all PRO workflows, as an unlabelled consignment cannot be dispatched. Labels are usually retrieved after a consignment has been allocated but before it has been manifested. Caution You can only retrieve labels for consignments that have been allocated to a carrier. If you attempt to return labels for an unallocated consignment, PRO returns an error. Getting Labels for an Entire Consignment PRO offers two endpoints that return labels for all packages in a consignment: Get Labels and Get Labels In Format : Get Labels returns labels for the specified consignment. It has only one parameter: the consignmentReference of the consignment you want to retrieve labels for. To call Get Labels , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/labels/{consignmentReference} . Get Labels in Format is similar to Get Labels , but enables you to specify the file format that you want the labels to be returned in. This must be one of PRO's supported consignment label formats: PDF, ZPL or ZPLII. To call Get Labels In Format , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/labels/{consignmentReference}/{labelFormat} . Getting Labels for an Individual Package PRO also offers two endpoints that return labels for a specific package in a consignment: Get Package Label and Get Package Label In Format : Get Package Label returns the label for the specified package. It has two required parameters: the packageReference of the relevant package and the consignmentReference of its associated consignment. To call Get Package Label , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/labels/package/{consignmentReference}/{packageReference} . Get Package Label in Format is similar to Get Package Label , but enables you to specify the file format that you want the label to be returned in. This must be one of PRO's supported package label formats: PDF, PNG, ZPL or ZPLII. To call Get Package Label In Format , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/labels/package/{consignmentReference}/{packageReference}/{labelFormat} . The Labels Response All Labels API endpoints return labels objects. The labels object has two properties: File - A base64-encoded byte array representing the file content. ContentType - The content type of the file (as specified in the Label Format parameter, where applicable). Request Examples https://api.electioapp.com/labels/EC-000-05D-1ST - a Get Labels request for all package labels associated with consignment EC-000-05D-1ST . https://api.electioapp.com/labels/EC-000-05D-1ST/pdf - a Get Labels In Format request for all package labels associated with consignment EC-000-05D-1ST in PDF format. https://api.electioapp.com/labels/EC-000-05D-1ST/EP-000-05F-1E8 - a Get Package Label request for the label of package EP-000-05F-1E8 , which is part of consignment EC-000-05D-1ST . https://api.electioapp.com/labels/EC-000-05D-1ST/EP-000-05F-1E8/pdf - a Get Package Label In Format request for the label of package EP-000-05F-1E8 , which is part of consignment EC-000-05D-1ST , in PDF format. Response Example The below example shows a typical label object. Label Object { \"File\": \"SlZCRVJpMHhMalFLSmRQcjZl ... VRrNU9ERUtKU1ZGVDBZPQ==\", \"ContentType\": \"application/pdf\" } Using the Label Data Once you have downloaded the file data, you will need to decode the file's Base64 in order to view the label itself. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Next Steps Learn how to add consignments to a carrier manifest at the Manifesting Consignments page.

This page explains how to use the Pickup Options endpoint to offer available pickup locations and timeslots. Using the Pickup Options Endpoint The Pickup Options endpoint takes the details of an as-yet uncreated consignment and returns available pickup options. This information can be used to offer pickup timeslots and locations for the product that the customer is about to purchase. Note For further information on what constitutes a pickup option, see the Using Delivery and Pickup Options page. To call the Pickup Options endpoint, send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/pickupoptions/ . At a minimum, the body of the request should contain the following information: Distance - The maximum distance from the destination address (in km) you want to receive results for. Max Results - The maximum number of results that you want to receive. This should be a value between one and 50. Package Information Origin Address Destination Address However, there are lots of other properties you can send when getting pickup options, including: Your own consignment reference. The consignment's source. Shipping and delivery dates. Customs documentation. The consignment's direction of travel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to record additional data about a consignment in custom fields. For more information on using metadata in PRO, see the Metadata page. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular consignment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Tags page. Providing extra information can help you to improve the relevance of the options returned, and means that any consignments or orders you generate from an option will be populated with richer data. Either the consignment's origin address, its destination address, or both, must include a valid ShippingLocationReference . For information on how to obtain a list of your organisation's shipping locations, see the Get Shipping Locations page of the API reference. The Pickup Options endpoint returns a {Locations} array listing all the pickup locations that can meet your request criteria. Each {Location} object contains a {DeliveryOptions} array listing the delivery options that are available to that location for the proposed consignment. Each {DeliveryOptions} object contains details of a particular option that could be used to deliver the consignment to the relevant {location} , including: Reference - A unique identifier for the option, used when selecting options in the next step. Delivery Date Start and End Time Carrier Service Cost of Delivery The latest Shipping Date and Time possible to meet the promise. The pickup options available for a given consignment can change over time. This is primarily due to different carriers collecting at different times at each shipping location, or the pickup locations provider updating the list of active locations. Caution Pickup locations are classified as having either finite or infinite capacity. For locations with finite capacity, PRO may disable or enable a location at any time in line with demand for the location. Sorted strongly advise that location details are never cached for re-use in the web store or checkout due to the dynamic nature of this information. Note For full reference information on the Pickup Options endpoint, see the Pickup Options page of the API reference. Pickup Options Example The example shows a request to get no more than 10 pickup options for a fairly standard consignment, all within 1km of the recipient's location. PRO returns one location that meets the requested criteria, and three options for delivery to that location. All three options use the same carrier service and have a delivery time window of 09:30 - 17:30, but are scheduled for different days. In practice, PRO is saying that the carrier can deliver to the pickup location during business hours on the 17th, 18th or 19th or March (as required by the customer).

Overview PRO has two endpoints that take the details of an as-yet uncreated consignment and return quotes for it: Get Quotes returns a simple list of delivery quotes for the potential consignment. Get Service Group Quotes returns a list of current service groups, along with quotes from the eligible services in each group. Note Both the Get Quotes and Get Service Group Quotes endpoints take a consignment object in the body of the request. However, they do not create consignments in and of themselves. In order to allocate to one of the quotes returned by these endpoints, you would need to first create the consignment. For more information on creating consignments, see the Creating Consignments page. Sending a Get Quotes Request To call Get Quotes , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/quotes/ . The body of the request should contain a consignment object. As a minimum, the Get Quotes endpoint requires you to send package weights and dimensions, origin address, and destination address data. You can either specify package weights and dimension via the Weight and Dimensions properties, or by supplying a PackageSizeReference . Note A PackageSizeReference is a unique identifier for a pre-defined, standardised package size. To configure standard package sizes, use the Configuration > Packaging Sizes page of the PRO UI. You can also view a list of your available standard package sizes by making a call to the Get Package Sizes API. Either the consignment's destination address, its origin address (if it has one), or both, must include a valid ShippingLocationReference . For information on how to obtain a list of your organisation's shipping locations, see the Get Shipping Locations page of the API reference. There are lots of optional properties you can send when getting quotes for a consignment, including: Your own consignment reference. Details of the specific items inside the consignment's packages. The consignment's source. Shipping and delivery dates. Customs documentation. The consignment's direction of travel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to us custom fields to record additional data about a consignment. For more information on using metadata in PRO, see the Metadata page. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular consignment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Tags page. Adding optional properties can help to improve the relevance and accuracy of the quote results that you get back from PRO. The Get Quotes Response Once it has received the request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes two lists: one containing Quotes and one containing UnqualifiedServices (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Each Quote object contains the following information: A unique reference for the quote. This property is important, as it is used when allocating consignments to the quote via the Allocate With Quote endpoint. Creation and expiry dates. The name and reference of the relevant carrier and carrier service. Origin and destination addresses. Collection date, and a delivery date range. Pricing information. Details on each leg of the journey (where applicable). The service direction. At this point, you would be able to display the relevant quote information to your customer service operative. Note For full reference information on the Get Quotes endpoint, see the API Reference . Example Get Quotes Call The example below shows a Get Quotes call for a fairly simple consignment. PRO has responded with one quote and two unavailable services.

The body of the request should contain a consignment object, structured in the same way as the Get Quotes request detailed above. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a list of available service groups, identified by Name and Reference . Each service group contains a CheapestQuote detailing the cheapest service in that group. The service group object also contains a list of Quotes for the services in the group (including the service detailed in the CheapestQuote property) and a list of UnqualifiedServices (that is, eligible services within the group for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Note For full reference information on the Get Service Group Quotes endpoint, see the API Reference . Get Service Group Quotes Example This simplified example shows a Get Service Group Quotes request for an outbound consignment. In this case, there is one service group configured in PRO, with the name Example Service Group . The group contains two services, with the service references SAMPLE_SERVICE01 and SAMPLE_SERVICE02 . PRO returns a single service group object. In this case, SAMPLE_SERVICE01 is the only eligible service, and so is displayed as both the CheapestQuote and the only entry in the Quotes array. SAMPLE_SERVICE02 is returned in the list of unqualified services.

The Get Quotes By Consignment Reference endpoint returns quotes based on the details of an existing consignment. Specifically, it takes a {consignmentReference} and returns an array of {Quotes} for that consignment. To call Get Quotes by Consignment Reference , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/quotes/consignment/{consignmentReference} . Once it has received the request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes two lists: one containing Quotes and one containing UnqualifiedServices (that is, services that have been disqualified from the quote process or that did not meet the delivery requirements for the consignment and were therefore unable to provide a quote). Each Quote object contains the following information: A unique reference for the quote. This property is important, as it is used when allocating consignments to the quote via the Allocate With Quote endpoint. Creation and expiry dates. The name and reference of the relevant carrier and carrier service. Origin and destination addresses. Collection date, and a delivery date range. Pricing information. Details on each leg of the journey (where applicable). The service direction. At this point, you would be able to display the relevant quote information to your customer service operative. Note For full reference information on the Get Quotes by Consignment Reference endpoint, see the Get Quotes by Consignment Reference page of the API reference. For an example call flow showing the Get Quotes by Consignment Reference endpoint being used, see the Quotes Flow page. Get Quotes by Consignment Reference Example The example shows a Get Quotes by Consignment Reference request and its accompanying response. In this case, SortedPRO has returned two quotes for the service. The next step in the process is to select one of those quotes.

Here you'll find a brief overview of PRO's Consignments APIs and how you can call them. <!-- > [!NOTE] > This site provides help and support for PRO version 1 (Consignments). We are about to launch a major update, adding support for PRO version 2 (Shipments). For a preview of the new content, click [here](https://docs-preview.sorted.com/pro/). --> Consignments Overview In PRO, a consignment is a collection of one or more packages that are shipped from the same origin address, to the same destination address, on behalf of the same Sorted customer, using the same carrier service, on the same day. Consignments form the basis of PRO's Consignments API suite, which enables you to build flexible shipping workflows that manage a consignment's journey from customer order right through to delivery. PRO's Consignments suite offers the following APIs: Allocation - Allocates consignments to an appropriate carrier service. Carrier Services - Returns available carrier services. Carriers - Returns available carriers. Consignments - Adds, gets, updates and deletes consignment information. Customs Docs - Returns customs docs for international consignments. Delivery Options - Returns potential delivery timeslots for consignments. Access to PRO's delivery option endpoints requires a SortedHERO license. This component is sold separately to the main SortedPRO product. Events - Searches for specified consignment events. Labels - Returns labels for a consignment. Manifest - Adds consignments to the relevant carrier manifest. Orders - Adds, gets, updates and deletes order information. Package Sizes - Returns standardised package sizes. Packages - Deletes a package from a consignment. Pickup Options - Returns potential pickup locations and timeslots for a consignment. Access to PRO's pickup option endpoints requires a SortedHERO license. This component is sold separately to the main SortedPRO product. Quotes - Returns manual delivery quotes for a consignment. Shipping Locations - Returns pre-configured shipping locations. Tracking - Returns tracking information for a consignment. Note For example API call flows, see the PRO Call Flows section. For API reference information, see the API Reference . Authentication You will need to provide a valid API key in every call you make to SortedPRO. When a new user account is created, PRO generates a unique API key and allocates it to the new user. To view your API key: Log in to the PRO dashboard and select Settings > Users & Roles > User Accounts to display the User Accounts page. A list of the user accounts that you have access to is displayed. Click the Edit User button for your account to display your account details. Click Show API Key . PRO prompts you to re-enter your UI password. Enter your password and click Retrieve API Key to display your API key. To use your API key, include it in an ocp-apim-subscription-key header when making calls to PRO. If you make an API call to PRO without including an API key, then PRO returns an error with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) . Example API key: ocp-apim-subscription-key: NzI1M2U0MjEtOTExNy00MWI1LWFlM2MtYTYxYTMwZmQ3NWM5 Specifying Request / Response Format PRO's APIs support both JSON and XML content types. You should state which content type you are sending for each API request sent to PRO. To do so, pass a content-type header with a value of application/json , text/xml or application/xml (as applicable) in your request. All other content types are invalid. You can also specify the content type that you want PRO to use in API responses. To do so, pass an accept header with a value of application/json , text/xml , or application/xml in your request. If you don't pass an accept header then PRO responds with application/json . JSON Example XML Example content-type: application/json accept: application/json content-type: application/xml accept: application/xml Specifying API Version You should include an electio-api-version header specifying the API version to use in all PRO API calls. The current version is 1.1 . electio-api-version: 1.1 Using the Sandbox Environment All of the URLs and examples given in this documentation relate to PRO's live production environment. However, PRO also offers a sandbox, enabling you to use a \"safe\" development environment in which you can integrate with PRO without running the risk of inadvertently transmitting data to carriers. The sandbox works in exactly the same way as the production environment, but is entirely self-contained and uses a separate dataset. In order to call APIs in the sandbox environment, you will first need to set up a sandbox API key. To do so, log in to the sandbox environment UI and follow the process listed in the Authentication section of this page. To call an API in the sandbox rather than the production environment, substitute the api.electioapp.com portion of the API's base URL with apisandbox.electioapp.com . Tip Don't forget to use your sandbox API key (as opposed to your production API key) in the ocp-apim-subscription-key header when making the call. For example, to call the Create Consignments endpoint in the production environment, you would send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments . To call the same endpoint in the sandbox, you would send a POST request to https://apisandbox.electioapp.com/consignments ."

This section explains how to create, retrieve and edit consignments. What Is a Consignment? In the context of PRO, the term \"consignment\" refers to a collection of one or more packages that are shipped from the same origin address, to the same destination address, on behalf of the same Sorted customer, using the same carrier service, on the same day. A consignment must contain at least one package. A package is a physical object to be shipped. Packages have dimensions, weight and value properties, and can contain items . Items are not mandatory properties within a package. As an example, suppose that a clothing retailer has received a customer order for a necklace, a bracelet, a coat, and a hat. As the necklace and bracelet are both physically small, the retailer elects to ship them in the same package. As such, this sales order would break down to: Four items - The necklace, the bracelet, the coat, and the hat. Three packages - One containing the necklace and bracelet, one containing the coat, and one containing the hat. A single consignment corresponding to everything on the order.

Example Get Order Call The example below shows a Get Order request for a fairly simple order with an {orderReference} of EO-000-002-K0R . Get Order Request Get Order Response GET https://api.electioapp.com/orders/EO-000-002-K0R { \"OrderReference\": \"EO-000-002-K0R\", \"OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": null, \"DeliveryOptionReference\": null, \"Packages\": [ { \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.00000, \"Length\": 10.00000, \"Height\": 10.00000 }, \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.50000, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"PackageSizeReference\": null, \"Items\": [ { \"Sku\": \"SKU093434\", \"Reference\": \"02f60a1ff80c4f799799b2e9f281dd22\", \"MetaData\": [], \"Quantity\": 1, \"Unit\": null, \"Description\": \"Striped Bamboo Red/White\", \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.00000, \"Length\": 10.00000, \"Height\": 10.00000 }, \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.50000, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"HarmonisationKeyWords\": [], \"Model\": null, \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.9900, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"CountryOfOrigin\": { \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"Barcode\": null, \"ContentClassification\": null, \"ContentClassificationDetails\": null, \"ItemReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"\", \"HarmonisationCode\": null } ], \"MetaData\": [], \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.9900, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"Reference\": \"EP-000-002-QPF\", \"PackageReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"\", \"Description\": \"Socks\", \"Barcode\": null } ], \"DateCreated\": \"2020-03-10T09:59:12.9275216+00:00\", \"RequiredDeliveryDate\": null, \"ShippingDate\": null, \"MetaData\": [], \"EarliestDeliveryDate\": null, \"LatestDeliveryDate\": null, \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.50000, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Source\": \"Api\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"Addresses\": [ { \"AddressType\": \"Origin\", \"ShopLocationReference\": null, \"Contact\": { \"Reference\": null, \"Title\": \"\", \"FirstName\": \"\", \"LastName\": \"\", \"Position\": null, \"Telephone\": \"\", \"Mobile\": \"\", \"LandLine\": \"\", \"Email\": \"\" }, \"CompanyName\": null, \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"Sorted1\", \"CustomerName\": null, \"AddressLine1\": null, \"AddressLine2\": null, \"AddressLine3\": null, \"Town\": null, \"Region\": null, \"Postcode\": \"\", \"Country\": null, \"RegionCode\": null, \"SpecialInstructions\": null, \"LatLong\": null, \"IsCached\": false }, { \"AddressType\": \"Destination\", \"ShopLocationReference\": null, \"Contact\": { \"Reference\": null, \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Position\": null, \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"CompanyName\": null, \"ShippingLocationReference\": null, \"CustomerName\": null, \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"AddressLine2\": null, \"AddressLine3\": null, \"Town\": null, \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"United Kingdom\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"RegionCode\": \"\", \"SpecialInstructions\": null, \"LatLong\": null, \"IsCached\": false } ], \"CustomsDocumentation\": null, \"Direction\": \"Outbound\", \"Tags\": [] } Updating Order Details The Update Order endpoint enables you to update an existing order. To call Update Order , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/orders/{orderReference} . When you make an Update Order request for a particular order, SortedPRO overwrites the existing order's details with new details provided in the body of the request. The structure of the Update Order request is identical to that of the Create Order request. PRO uses the following rules when updating order properties: {OrderReference} - Required property. Cannot be updated. {OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {RequiredDeliveryDate} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {Source} - Ignored. Cannot be updated. {ShippingDate} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {Packages} - Ignored. Use the Pack Order endpoint to manage an order's packages instead. {CustomsDocumentation} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {Addresses} - If any values are provided, then PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no values are provided, PRO makes no changes to the order. {MetaData} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {Direction} - If any values are provided, then PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no values are provided, PRO makes no changes to the order. {Tags} - If any values are provided, then PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no values are provided, PRO makes no changes to the order. Note For full reference information on the Update Order endpoint, see the Update Order page of the API reference. Once it has received the request, PRO updates the order and returns a code 200 message as confirmation. Update Order Example The example shows an Update Order request to update delivery and shipping dates on an order with an {orderReference} of EO-000-002-K0R . Update Order Request Update Order Response PUT https://api.electioapp.com/orders/EO-000-002-K0R { \"OrderReference\": \"EO-000-002-K0R\", \"RequiredDeliveryDate\": { \"Date\": \"2020-06-05T00:00:00+01:00\", \"IsToBeExactlyOnTheDateSpecified\": true }, \"ShippingDate\": \"2020-05-31T00:00:00+01:00\" } Adding and Updating Order Addresses In addition to the Update Order endpoint, PRO also features specific endpoints for adding and updating the addresses on a consignment. The Add Address To Order endpoint enables you to add a new address to an order. To call Add Address To Order , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/orders/{orderReference}/address . Add Address To Order can only be used to add addresses with an address type that does not already exist on the order. For example, suppose that you have an order that already has Origin and Destination addresses. You could use Add Address To Order to add a new Sender address to that order (because the order does not currently have a Sender address), but you could not use it to add a new Origin address (because the order does have an existing Origin ). The Update Address On Order endpoint enables you to update an existing address on an order. To call Update Address On Order , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/orders/{orderReference}/address . Update Address On Order can only be used to edit addresses with an address type already exists on the order. For example, suppose that you have an order that already has Origin and Destination addresses. You could use Update Address On Order to edit those addresses (by using it to send a new address object with that AddressType ), but not to add others of a different type. For both of these endpoints, the body of the request should contain an address object. The example below shows a new Sender address. Example Address Object { \"AddressType\": \"Sender\", \"Contact\": { \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"CompanyName\": \"Update Address On Order Ltd.\", \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"AddressLine2\": \"Pressington\", \"AddressLine3\": \"Carlsby\", \"Town\": \"Manchester\", \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"Great Britain\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"SpecialInstructions\": \"Gate code: 4454\", \"LatLong\": { \"Latitude\": 53.474220, \"Longitude\": -2.246049 }, \"IsCached\": false } Both Add Address To Order and Update Address On Order return an empty code 200 message as confirmation that the address change was successful. Note For full reference information on the Add Address To Order endpoint, see the Add Address To Order page of the API reference.

This section explains how to create order objects, how to create consignments from orders, and how to manage existing orders. What Is an Order? In PRO, an order represents a collection of packages that is to be transported to the same destination and on behalf of the same customer. At first glance, an order object looks very similar to a consignment object. As such, it's important to understand the difference between a consignment and an order when using Pack Order : An order is a collection of items that is to be transported to the same destination on behalf of the same customer. A consignment is a collection of packages that is to be transported to the same destination, on behalf of the same customer, from the same origin, on the same day, and by the same carrier . This means that orders can contain items that will not ship from the same location, but consignments cannot. Similarly, orders can contain items that will ship from the same location but at different times (for example, because one of the items a customer has purchased is out of stock). Using Orders Once you have created an order, you would need to use the Pack Order endpoint to generate shippable consignments from it. In this stage of the process you are effectively splitting the items on the order up into groups that meet the definition of a consignment (that is: items that share an origin, ship date, and carrier). Suppose that a clothing retailer has received a customer order for a necklace, a bracelet, a coat, and a hat. As the necklace and bracelet are both physically small, the retailer elects to ship them in the same package. The necklace and bracelet are located in warehouse A, and the coat and hat in warehouse B. This would break down to: A single order comprising the customer's entire purchase. Two consignments - One with a single item for the package containing the necklace and bracelet, and another with separate packages for the coat and hat. Three packages - One containing the necklace and bracelet, one containing the coat, and one containing the hat. Four items - The necklace, the bracelet, the coat, and the hat. In this example, you would need to run Pack Order twice - once for each consignment.

This section explains the various ways in which you can get delivery quotes for a consignment, and how to generate and allocate consignments from a selected quote. What Is a Quote In PRO? In PRO, delivery quotes are generally used outside of a \"regular\" consignment allocation workflow, as a means of managing consignments that require manual intervention. For example, your customer service teams might want to get quotes for an expedited delivery on a consignment that was missed by a carrier and so did not meet its delivery promise. PRO's Quotes API enables you to get delivery quotes for both as-yet uncreated and existing consignments. All Quotes endpoints return one or more Quote objects, of which each represents an offer for carriage of a consignment with a specific carrier service. Each quote can be uniquely identified by a {quoteReference} , which is used when selecting a quote via the Allocate With Quote endpoint. Allocate With Quote The Allocate With Quote endpoint is a key part of all PRO quotes workflows, enabling you to allocate a consignment to the carrier service returned in a particular quote. It is covered in the Allocation section of this site, as it is part of the Allocation API: For reference information on Allocate With Quote , see the API reference For a user guide on the Allocate With Quote endpoint, see the Allocating to a Specific Quote page, in the Allocating Consignments section.

This page explains how to manifest consignments, how to view existing customer manifests, and how to set a consignment as Ready to Ship . Manifesting Overview In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting consignment data to carriers. It is the final step of most PRO workflows. You can only manifest consignments that are in a state of Allocated , Manifest Failed , or ReadyToShip . If you attempt to manifest a consignment that is not in one of these states then PRO returns an error. PRO has two manifest endpoints: Manifest Consignments enables you to manifest multiple consignments at once by providing a list of {consignmentReferences} . Manifest Consignments From Query enables you to manifest all consignments that meet a specified set of search criteria. Caution Every successful request to a manifest endpoint results in data being transmitted to the carrier. Therefore, Sorted strongly advise that you do not manifest consignments individually, and that consignment manifesting is aligned with the carrier collection times from the warehouse. Manifesting a consignment changes its state to Manifested . At this point the carrier is aware of the consignment, and will collect it unless otherwise advised. In order to prevent the consignment being shipped, you would need to either cancel or deallocate it. Note For more information on cancelling consignments, see the Cancelling Consignments page. For more information on deallocating consignments, see the Deallocating Consignments page. At this point, you should also look to print labels for the consignment, if you have not already done so. See Getting Labels for an explanation of how to retrieve package labels. Note For worked examples showing consignments being manifested, see any of the flows in the Example Call Flows section. Manifesting Consignments Perhaps the simplest way to manifest consignments in PRO is to use the Manifest Consignment endpoint. Manifest Consignment enables you to manifest multiple consignments at once by providing their ConsignmentReferences . To call Manifest Consignments , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/manifest . The body of the request should contain a ConsignmentReferences list. Once PRO has received the request, it attempts to manifest the consignments listed in the request. The system then returns an array of messages indicating whether each individual consignment was successfully manifested. Note For full reference information on the Manifest Consignments endpoint, see the Manifest Consignments page of the API Reference. Examples The example shows a request to manifest three consignments. The response indicates that all three consignments were successfully manifested. Manifest Consignments Request Manifest Consignments Response PUT https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/manifest { \"ConsignmentReferences\": [ \"EC-000-05A-Z6S\", \"EC-000-083-45D\", \"EC-000-A04-0DV\" ] } [ { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment EC-000-002-5FG has been manifested successfully.\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-002-5FG\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"Link\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-002-5FG\" } ] }, { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment EC-000-002-5FG has been manifested successfully.\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-002-5FG\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"Link\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-002-5FG\" } ] }, { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment EC-000-002-5FG has been manifested successfully.\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-002-5FG\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"Link\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-002-5FG\" } ] } ] Manifesting Consignments Using a Query The Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint enables you to manifest consignments using a query, rather than by providing consignment references directly. To call Manifest Consignments From Query , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/manifestFromQuery . The body of the request should contain consignment search criteria. You can use the following query fields: ShippingLocationReference - The shipping location that the consignment will ship from. For information on how to obtain a list of your organisation's shipping locations and their references, see the Get Shipping Locations page of the API reference. States - The state that the consignments should be in. All the consignments you provide in the request should be in a state of either Allocated , Manifest Failed , or ReadyToShip . If you attempt to manifest a consignment that is not in one of these states then PRO returns an error. Carriers - The carriers that the consignments are allocated to. LabelsPrinted - Whether or not the labels for the consignments have already been printed. ShippingDate - The date that the consignment is scheduled to ship. ShippingDateRanges - A range of scheduled shipping dates. Once the request is received, PRO attempts to manifest any consignments that meet the specified criteria. PRO then returns a Message indicating how many consignments met the terms of the query and how many it was able to add to the manifest queue. It also returns a FailedConsignments array listing the consignmentReferences of those consignments that PRO was unable to queue for manifest. Note For full reference information on the Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint, see the Manifest Consignments From Query page of the API Reference. Setting Consignments As Ready to Ship PRO's Set Ready To Ship and Set Not Ready To Ship endpoints can help you when manifesting consignments from queries. These endpoints set a consignment's consignmentState to ReadyToShip . Although setting a consignment as ready to ship doesn't alter the consignment in and of itself, it can be useful as a means of marking consignments as ready for manifest via the Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint. To call Set Ready To Ship , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/setreadytoship . The body of the request should comprise a list containing the {consignmentReferences} of all the consignments you want to set as ReadyToShip . Note You can only set consignments that are in an Allocated state as ReadyToShip . Once the request is received, PRO changes the consignmentStates of all the relevant consignments to ReadyToShip and returns a confirmation message. You could then manifest these consignments with a simple Manifest Consignments From Query call adding all consignments in that state to the manifest queue. The example below shows a successful request to set two consignments as ReadyToShip , and a further Manifest Consignments From Query call to manifest all consignments in that state. Ready To Ship Request Ready To Ship Response Manifest Query PUT https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/setreadytoship [ \"EC-000-05D-EM7\", \"EC-000-05D-EKV\" ] [ { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment marked as Ready To Ship completed successfully\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-05D-EM7\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"detail\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05D-EM7\" } ] }, { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment marked as Ready To Ship completed successfully\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-05D-EKV\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"detail\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05D-EKV\" } ] } ] POST https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/manifestFromQuery { \"States\": [ \"ReadyToShip\" ] } The Set Not Ready To Ship endpoint works in exactly the same way as Set Ready To Ship , only in reverse. It takes the consignmentReferences of consignments in a ReadyToShip state and returns them to a state of Allocated , enabling them to be deallocated (and subsequently edited if required) or cancelled. To call Set Not Ready To Ship , send a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/setnotreadytoship . The body of the request should comprise a list containing the {consignmentReferences} of all the consignments you want to return to an Allocated state. The example below shows a successful Set Not Ready To Ship request for a single consignment. Not Ready To Ship Request Not Ready To Ship Response PUT https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/setnotreadytoship [ \"EC-000-05D-GHR\" ] [ { \"IsSuccess\": true, \"Message\": \"Consignment set back to Allocated from Ready To Ship completed successfully\", \"Data\": \"EC-000-05D-GHR\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"detail\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05D-GHR\" } ] } ] Manifest Consignments From Query Example The example shows a request to manifest all consignments that are allocated to Carrier X, shipping from a location with the ShippingLocationReference Location1 , and have already had their labels printed. The response indicates that PRO found 10 consignments meeting these criteria, and that all 10 were successfully queued for manifest. Manifest From Query Request Manifest From Query Response POST https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/manifestFromQuery { \"ShippingLocationReferences\": [ \"Location1\" ], \"States\": [ \"Allocated\" ], \"Carriers\": [ \"CARRIER_X\" ], \"LabelsPrinted\": true } { \"Message\": \"Query found 10 consignment(s). 10 successfully queued to manifest. 0 failed to be added to the queue\" } Retrieving Customer Manifests PRO has two endpoints that enable you to retrieve current customer manifest details: Get Customer Manifests enables you to retrieve a summary of all current manifests. Get Customer Manifest enables you to download an individual manifest file as a PDF. Retrieving a Manifest Summary To call Get Customer Manifests , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/customer/manifests . Optionally, you can add a ?shippingLocationReference=string parameter, where shippingLocationReference is the unique reference of a shipping location you want to retrieve manifests for. Note You can get a list of valid shipping locations by calling the Get Shipping Locations endpoint. For reference information on Get Shipping Locations , see the API Reference . Once it has received the request, PRO returns a summary of all current manifests, including the following information: The manifest's unique reference. The filename of the manifest. The date the manifest was created. The name of the carrier. The number of bookings on the manifest. If you added a shippingLocationReference parameter, then the summary only includes manifests that correspond to shipments from that particular shipping location. Example Get Customer Manifests Request This example shows a request for details of all manifests associated with shipping location EDC5-SL1 . PRO has returned a summary of three manifest files. Get Customer Manifests Request Get Customer Manifests Response GET https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/customer/manifests?shippingLocationReference=EDC5-SL1 [ { \"ManifestReference\": \"3837b862e2ab47de95f11c016f36f072\", \"ManifestFileStorageContainer\": \"electio-carrierbooking-sandbox-upsready-edc5-ups\", \"ManifestFileName\": \"EDC5_SL1-3837b862e2ab47de95f11c016f36f072.pdf\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"EDC5-SL1\", \"ShippingLocationName\": null, \"Created\": \"2019-09-16T09:09:56.9894014+00:00\", \"CarrierName\": \"Ups\", \"BookingsCount\": 1, \"ManifestFileNameSentToCarrier\": null }, { \"ManifestReference\": \"ffe8739761624fc695e3fbcb72a63557\", \"ManifestFileStorageContainer\": \"electio-carrierbooking-sandbox-upsready-edc5-ups\", \"ManifestFileName\": \"EDC5_SL1-ffe8739761624fc695e3fbcb72a63557.pdf\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"EDC5-SL1\", \"ShippingLocationName\": null, \"Created\": \"2019-08-15T12:20:06.5067094+00:00\", \"CarrierName\": \"Ups\", \"BookingsCount\": 1, \"ManifestFileNameSentToCarrier\": null }, { \"ManifestReference\": \"49fcade22cf24458b1314704a4102738\", \"ManifestFileStorageContainer\": \"electio-carrierbooking-sandbox-upsready-edc5-ups\", \"ManifestFileName\": \"EDC5_SL1-49fcade22cf24458b1314704a4102738.pdf\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"EDC5-SL1\", \"ShippingLocationName\": null, \"Created\": \"2019-08-14T09:30:54.4984558+00:00\", \"CarrierName\": \"Ups\", \"BookingsCount\": 1, \"ManifestFileNameSentToCarrier\": null } ] Downloading a Manifest File The Get Customer Manifest endpoint enables you to download an individual manifest file in PDF format. To call Get Customer Manifest , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/customer/manifest/{manifestReference} , where {manifestReference} is the unique reference of the manifest you want to download. Note You can get the ManifestReference for a particular manifest by making a Get Customer Manifests request for a summary of existing manifest details. Each manifest summary returned contains a ManifestReference . Once the request is received, PRO returns the specified manifest file as a base-64 encoded byte array. You will need to decode the file in order to view the label itself. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information.

This array can be used to record additional data about the consignment in custom fields. This page explains how to do so. Metadata Overview The MetaData array has two parts - the KeyValue and the metadata values. The KeyValue is the name of the property, while the metadata values are the data items themselves. The fields that should be used to store this data varies depending on the data types being stored. Metadata values can be stored in the following fields: StringValue - used to store data as a string. IntValue - used to store data as an integer. DecimalValue - used to store data as a decimal. DateTimeValue - used to store data as a DateTimeOffset. BoolValue - used to store data as a Boolean (true/false). Each metadata object can contain multiple data items, but can only contain one data item of each type. For example, a MetaData array containing a StringValue and a BoolValue would be valid, but a MetaData array containing two StringValue keys would not. Metadata Example The example shows a MetaData array that is being used to store a consignment's picking data. The StringValue property is being used to record the name of the picker, and the DateTimeValue is being used to record the date and time that the consignment was picked. Metadata Property \"MetaData\": [ { \"KeyValue\": \"Picked_On\", \"StringValue\": \"Josh Allen\", \"DateTimeValue\": \"2019-06-04T00:00:00+01:00\" } ]"

This page explains how to create consignments from an order. Using Pack Order The Pack Order endpoint enables you to take those items on an order that share an origin and are to be shipped together, and generate a shippable consignment from them. You will need to send one Pack Order request per consignment that you want to create from the order. To call Pack Order , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/orders/{orderReference}/pack . At a minimum, the body of the request should contain the {orderReference} of the associated order and details of at least one {item} (and its accompanying {package} ). The items and packages listed make up the consignment. If required, you can also populate the resulting consignment with a custom order reference and additional MetaData , CustomsDocumentation , and Tags . Each item must be identified by a Reference , an ItemReferenceProvidedByCustomer , or a Sku . These fields are not mandatory in themselves, but one of them must be present for each item. Note PRO validates the items on a Pack Order request against its associated order. For example, the system will return an error if you make a Pack Order request including an item with a Sku of 12345 if there is no item with that Sku on the corresponding order. However, PRO does not validate the items on a Pack Order request against previous Pack Order requests. The Pack Order endpoint can be called multiple times for the same order and items. This allows for split picks and short picks to backorder in an operation. Once SortedPRO has received a Pack Order request, it creates the consignment and returns the relevant {consignmentReference} . The consignment's details are taken from the body of the Pack Order request. Fields that are not part of the request (because they are either NULL or not part of the Pack Order request structure) are populated from the details of the specified order. Providing a Custom Order Reference The Pack Order request's OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer field enables you to provide a custom reference for the consignment that the request generates. This is a separate field to the OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer used on the order itself, and behaves in the following ways: If you add a custom reference to your Pack Order request, then PRO uses this value as the consignment's custom reference, even if there is a different custom reference on the order itself. If you do not add a custom reference to your Pack Order request, but the order does have a custom reference, then PRO populates the resulting consignment's OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer using the value from the order. If neither the order or the Pack Order request has a custom reference specified, then PRO creates the consignment without a custom reference. Generating Return Consignments You can automatically generate a return consignment at the same time as well as an outbound consignment by using the GenerateReturn flag. When PRO receives a Pack Order request that has GenerateReturn set to true , it creates and returns two consignments - one outbound and one inbound. The inbound consignment is identical to the outbound consignment, with the exception that its Origin and Destination addresses are swapped. Pack Order Example The example shows a Pack Order request to create a consignment with one package containing a single item from order EO-000-002-0TT . PRO creates the consignment and responds with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MQ4 . Pack Order Request Pack Order Response POST https://api.electioapp.com/orders/EO-000-002-0TT/pack { \"OrderReference\": \"EO-000-002-0TT\", \"OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"MyOrderRef001\", \"GenerateReturn\": false, \"Packages\": [ { \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 15.4, \"Length\": 21.7, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 1.3, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"PackageSizeReference\": \"\", \"Items\": [ { \"Sku\": \"SKU093434\", \"Quantity\": 1 } ] } ], \"MetaData\": [ { \"KeyValue\": \"SampleKey\", \"StringValue\": \"SampleValue\" } ] } { \"Results\": [ { \"Result\": \"ConsignmentCreated\", \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"Consignment\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05B-MQ4\" } ] } ] } Note For full reference information on the Pack Order endpoint, see the Pack Order page of the API reference.

Selecting Options As a Consignment The Select Option endpoint enables you to record a customer's choice of delivery or pickup option in SortedPRO. PRO generates and allocates a consignment from the details of the selected option. To call Select Option , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/select/{deliveryOptionReference} . There is no body content required for the request. Once it has received the request, PRO creates a consignment using the consignment that details were passed as part of the original request to get delivery options. Next, the system allocates the consignment in line with the delivery promise specified in the selected option. Generally, this means allocating to the carrier service returned in the original option, but PRO can allocate to an alternative service in certain circumstances. The delivery option guarantees the delivery promise, but not the carrier service. PRO then returns links to the consignment resource that was allocated, a summary of the carrier service that the consignment was allocated to, a link to the relevant package labels, and a ConsignmentLegs array indicating how many legs the shipment will need. Where a shipment would need multiple legs to complete, the ConsignmentLegs array shows tracking details for each individual leg. Note For full reference information on the Select Option endpoint, see the Select Option page of the API reference. For an example call flow in which consignments are created using Select Order , see the Consumer Options call flow page. Select Option Example The example shows a request to select a delivery option that has a {deliveryOptionReference} of EDO-000-6DX-6XP . PRO creates a consignment with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MMQ , which it then allocates to the carrier service associated with delivery option EDO-000-6DX-6XP . PRO then returns the relevant {consignmentReference} and label link, enabling you to get labels for and manifest the consignment. Select Option Request Select Option Response POST https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/select/EDO-000-6DX-6XP { \"StatusCode\": 200, \"ApiLinks\": [ { \"Rel\": \"detail\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-05B-MMQ\" }, { \"Rel\": \"label\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/labels/EC-000-05B-MMQ\" } ], \"Description\": \"Consignment EC-000-05B-MMQ has been successfully allocated with Carrier X Tracked 48 Signed For for shipping on 17/06/2019 00:00:00 +00:00\", \"ConsignmentLegs\": [ { \"Leg\": 1, \"TrackingReferences\": [ \"TRK00009823\" ], \"CarrierReference\": \"CARRIER_X\", \"CarrierServiceReference\": null, \"CarrierName\": \"Carrier X\" } ], \"CarrierReference\": \"CARRIER_X\", \"CarrierName\": \"Carrier X\", \"CarrierServiceReference\": \"MPD_T48CX\", \"CarrierServiceName\": \"Tracked 48 Signed For\" } Selecting Options As an Order The Select Option As Order endpoint enables you to record a customer's choice of delivery or pickup option as an order rather than a consignment. You can then pack the resulting order into multiple consignments as per the PRO order process. Select Option As Order enables you to select multiple delivery and/or pickup options at once. Using Select Option As Order combines the benefits of PRO's delivery options and orders features, enabling you to offer your customers delivery options even if their orders need to be shipped in multiple consignments. Note For more information on using orders in PRO, see the Managing Orders section. To call Select Option As Order , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/deliveryoptions/selectorder . The body of the request should contain a DeliveryOptions array listing the delivery options you want to select as orders. Each DeliveryOption must contain a delivery option Reference , which is used to identify the order you want to select. If require, you can also add an OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer and metadata to be added to the resulting order. Once it has received the Select Delivery Option as an Order request, PRO uses the details of the selected option to create an order and returns an object containing the associated {orderReferences} . Note For full reference information on the Select Delivery Option as an Order endpoint, see the Select Delivery Option as an Order page of the API reference. Select Option As Order Example The example shows a request to select a delivery option that has a {Reference} of EDO-000-6DX-6XP as an order. PRO takes that delivery option's details and creates an order with an {orderReference} of EO-000-002-0TT . Select Option As Order Request Select Option As Order Response { \"DeliveryOptions\": [ { \"Reference\": \"EDO-000-6DX-6XP\", \"OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"MYORDEREF001\", \"MetaData\": [ { \"KeyValue\": \"OrderReference\", \"StringValue\": \"10045634343\" } ] } ] } { \"SelectOrderResults\": [ { \"DeliveryOptionReference\": \"EDO-000-6DX-6XP\", \"OrderReference\": \"EO-000-002-0TT\", \"Status\": 201, \"Message\": null, \"Links\": [ { \"Rel\": \"Detail\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/orders/EEO-000-002-0TT\" } ] } ] } Next Steps Learn how to manifest consignments at the Manifesting Consignments page.

This page explains how to use and combine tags. Tags Overview Tagged shipments can only be allocated to those carrier services that have a matching tag. You can still allocate untagged shipments to a carrier service that has tags. To associate tags with carrier services, use the Settings > Carrier Services > [select carrier service] > Allocation Rules > Allocation Filtering Tags panel of the SortedPRO UI. For example, a retailer might use the UI to add a Flammables tag to all the carrier services that they wanted to use for flammable products. They would then add the Flammables tag to all consignments containing flammable products. PRO would only allocate those consignments tagged as Flammables to a consignment in the pre-approved Flammables list. Scenarios Suppose that you set your carrier services up in the following way: You tag Carrier Service A with Alcohol . You tag Carrier Service B with Flammables . You tag Carrier Service C with Alcohol and Flammables . You tag Carrier Service D with Oil . You don't add any tags to Carrier Service E. This configuration would produce the following results: Consignment with no tags - A, B, C, D, and E are returned. Consignment tagged with Alcohol - A and C are returned. Consignment tagged with Flammables - B and C are returned. Consignment tagged with Alcohol and Flammables - C is returned. Consignment tagged with Alcohol , Flammables , and Oil - No services are returned. Tags Example The example shows a tags property for a consignment that contains flammable materials, oil and alcohol. Tags Property \"Tags\": [ \"Flammables\", \"Oil\", \"Alcohol\" ]"

You can track packages either via PRO's own tracking API, or via REACT, Sorted's dedicated carrier tracking product. This section explains how to use both options. PRO Tracking Overview PRO's Tracking API is intended to drive simple web-based tracking pages. When the API is called, PRO returns a response listing the tracking events that have occurred since that package was dispatched. Tracking events are informational messages returned from carriers that provide details about the status of the consignment. You can then display this information to your customers through your site. Alternatively, you can use SortedREACT to offer a richer tracking experience to your customers. As well as APIs that work in a similar way to PRO's Tracking API, REACT offers a full suite of tracking features, including push notifications via webhook, reports, and the ability to build custom tracking pages without any development work. When you sign up for REACT as well as PRO, REACT automatically converts the PRO consignments you create into its own shipment records. Tracking Section Contents Using PRO's Tracking API - Explains how to call the Tracking API. Tracking Consignments Using REACT - Gives an overview of how REACT and PRO interact. Note All of the URLs and examples given in this documentation relate to PRO's live production environment. To call APIs in the sandbox environment, substitute the api.electioapp.com portion of the API's base URL with apisandbox.electioapp.com . Don't forget to use your sandbox API key (as opposed to your production API key) when making the call. For more information on PRO's sandbox, see Using the Sandbox Environment ."

PRO can automatically register shipments with REACT, and share carrier and tracking information. This page explains how PRO and REACT can interact with each other, and the benefits this brings. Note For integration guides and user help on REACT, see the REACT section of this site. Why Use REACT? PRO's native tracking API enables you to build simple tracking pages that a consumer can access to check the status of their order. REACT, on the other hand, offers a full suite of tracking tools, giving you much more flexibility in the way that you supply tracking updates to your customers. REACT offers: Custom webhooks that notify you of shipping events proactively. Whenever a shipment enters a selected state, REACT will send that shipment’s data to you, thereby enabling you to build services such as push notifications as email alerts. A tracking dashboard that gives you advanced shipment monitoring features, and enables administrators to configure the system. Customisable shipment state labels, enabling you to to communicate tracking information to your customers in your brand’s tone of voice or in an alternative language, as opposed to using default tracking state names. Customisable web-based tracking pages that can be published with no development work needed. Calculated events, whereby shipment properties are changes based on REACT's internal processing rather than a carrier update. For example, REACT can automatically flag a shipment as late if it passes its expected delivery date. Integrating PRO and REACT When you sign up to REACT as a PRO customer, your REACT and PRO accounts are automatically linked. You do not need to do any additional configuration beyond the regular configuration processes for each product. REACT uses carrier connectors to keep shipments from a particular carrier up to date. Carrier connectors contain configuration that enables REACT to obtain carrier tracking data. Ordinarily, you would need to configure carrier connectors yourself as part of the REACT setup process. However, when you sign up to REACT as a PRO customer, REACT takes your carrier configuration from PRO, enabling you to use your existing carrier integrations in REACT without needing to provide any additional details. To use your PRO carriers with REACT, navigate to Settings > Carrier Connectors within the REACT UI, and click Connect . Registering PRO Consignments in REACT Once PRO and REACT have been linked, PRO will automatically create new REACT shipments from manifested consignments. The process is as follows: PRO tells REACT that a consignment has been manifested and sends the details of that consignment to REACT. REACT validates the consignment details and generates a new REACT shipment object from it. REACT registers the shipment via its Register Shipments API. At this point, the shipment can now be tracked in the same way as any other REACT shipment.

Need to add a requested delivery date? Not a problem. This page explains how to use API calls to update consignment and package details in SortedPRO. Updating Consignments The Update Consignment endpoint enables you to update one or more existing consignments. When you make an Update Consignment request for a particular consignment, SortedPRO overwrites the existing consignment details with new details provided in the body of the request. To call Update Consignment , make a PUT request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/ . The consignmentReference of the consignment to be updated is specified in the body of the request, but the structure of the Update Consignment request is otherwise identical to that of the Create Consignment request. You can add multiple consignment objects to the list if required. PRO uses the following rules when updating consignment properties: {Reference} - Required property. Cannot be updated. {Source} - Ignored. Cannot be updated. {ShippingDate} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {RequestedDeliveryDate} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {ConsignmentReferenceProvidedByCustomer} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {CustomsDocumentation} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {MetaData} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. {Addresses} - PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no value is provided, any existing value is deleted. You cannot update addresses after a consignment has been allocated. {Packages} - If any values are provided, then PRO attempts to replace the entire property with the updated values. You cannot update packages after a consignment has been allocated. If no values are provided, PRO makes no changes to the consignment. {Tags} - If any values are provided, then PRO replaces the entire property with the updated values. If no values are provided, PRO makes no changes to the consignment. Once the consignment is updated, PRO returns a link to the consignment object. Note For full reference information on the Update Consignment endpoint, see the Update Consignment page of the API reference. Update Consignments Example The example shows an Update Consignment request for a single shipment that has a {ConsignmentReference} of EC-000-087-01A . For a further example of an Update Consignment request (including packages being updated), see the API Reference . Update Consignments Request Update Consignments Response PUT https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/ { \"ShippingDate\": \"2019-06-02T00:00:00+01:00\", \"Reference\": \"EC-000-087-01A\", \"RequestedDeliveryDate\": { \"Date\": \"2019-06-05T00:00:00+01:00\", \"IsToBeExactlyOnTheDateSpecified\": false }, \"ConsignmentReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"Your Reference\", \"CustomsDocumentation\": { \"DesignatedPersonResponsible\": \"Peter McPetersson\", \"ImportersVatNumber\": \"02345555\", \"CategoryType\": \"Other\", \"ShipperCustomsReference\": \"CREF0001\", \"ImportersTaxCode\": \"TC001\", \"ImportersTelephone\": \"0161123456\", \"ImportersFax\": \"01611124547\", \"ImportersEmail\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\", \"CN23Comments\": \"Comments\", \"ReferencesOfAttachedInvoices\": [ \"INV001\" ], \"ReferencesOfAttachedCertificates\": [ \"CERT001\" ], \"ReferencesOfAttachedLicences\": [ \"LIC001\" ], \"CategoryTypeExplanation\": \"Explanation\", \"DeclarationDate\": \"2019-05-31T00:00:00+01:00\", \"OfficeOfPosting\": \"Manchester\", \"ReasonForExport\": \"Sale\", \"ShippingTerms\": \"CFR\", \"ShippersVatNumber\": \"874541414\", \"ReceiversTaxCode\": \"TC5454\", \"ReceiversVatNumber\": \"8745474\", \"InvoiceDate\": \"2019-05-31T00:00:00+01:00\" }, \"Addresses\": [ { \"AddressType\": \"Origin\", \"ShippingLocationReference\": \"Shipping_Location_Reference\", \"IsCached\": false }, { \"AddressType\": \"Destination\", \"Contact\": { \"Title\": \"Mr\", \"FirstName\": \"Peter\", \"LastName\": \"McPetersson\", \"Telephone\": \"07702123456\", \"Mobile\": \"07702123456\", \"LandLine\": \"0161544123\", \"Email\": \"peter.mcpetersson@test.com\" }, \"CompanyName\": \"Test Company (UK) Ltd.\", \"AddressLine1\": \"13 Porter Street\", \"AddressLine2\": \"Pressington\", \"AddressLine3\": \"Carlsby\", \"Town\": \"Manchester\", \"Region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"Postcode\": \"M1 5WG\", \"Country\": { \"Name\": \"Great Britain\", \"IsoCode\": { \"TwoLetterCode\": \"GB\" } }, \"SpecialInstructions\": \"Gate code: 4454\", \"LatLong\": { \"Latitude\": 53.474220, \"Longitude\": -2.246049 }, \"IsCached\": false } ], \"MetaData\": [ { \"KeyValue\": \"Updated_Key\", \"StringValue\": \"Updated_Value\" } ], \"Tags\": [ \"TagC\" ] } [ { \"Rel\": \"Link\", \"Href\": \"https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-087-01A\" } ] Adding Packages If you just want to add a package to a single existing consignment, you could use the Add Package endpoint rather than Update Consignment . Caution You can only add packages to consignments that are in a status of either Unallocated or Allocation Failed . If you need to add a package to a consignment that has been allocated, you will need to first deallocate that consignment. For more information on deallocating consignments, see the Deallocating Consignments page. To call Add Package , send a POST request to https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{consignmentReference}/addpackage . The body of the request should contain the details of the package that you want to add, structured in the same way as the package property in a Create Consignment request. The package's weight , dimensions , description and value are mandatory, but all other package properties are optional. Once it receives the request, PRO adds a new package with the supplied details to the specified consignment, and returns the full package object. Note that this object now includes the package's Reference . A package reference is a unique identifier for each package in PRO, and takes the format EP-xxx-xxx-xxx . Note For full reference information on the Add Package endpoint, see the API reference . Add Package Example The below example shows a simple package object being added to a consignment. PRO creates the package and returns the full package object, including a newly-generated Reference of EP-000-05F-0CY . For an example of a more detailed Add Package request, see the API reference . Add Package Request Add Package Response POST https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/EC-000-087-01A/addpackage { \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.5, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.0, \"Length\": 10.0, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Description\": \"Updated Description\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } } } { \"ConsignmentLegs\": [], \"Items\": [], \"Charges\": [], \"Reference\": \"EP-000-05F-0CY\", \"PackageReferenceProvidedByCustomer\": \"\", \"Weight\": { \"Value\": 0.5, \"Unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"Dimensions\": { \"Unit\": \"Cm\", \"Width\": 10.0, \"Length\": 10.0, \"Height\": 10.0 }, \"Description\": \"Updated Description\", \"Value\": { \"Amount\": 5.99, \"Currency\": { \"Name\": \"Pound Sterling\", \"IsoCode\": \"GBP\" } }, \"PackageSizeReference\": null, \"Barcode\": null, \"MetaData\": [] } Deleting Packages You can delete a package from its associated consignment using the Delete Package endpoint. To call Delete Package , send a DELETE request to https://api.electioapp.com/packages/{packageReference} . PRO deletes the supplied package, and returns a code 200 response with no body. You can only delete packages from consignments that are in a status of either Unallocated or Allocation Failed . If you need to add a package to a consignment that has been allocated, you will need to first deallocate that consignment. For more information on deallocating consignments, see the Deallocating Consignments page. You cannot delete the last package in a consignment. If you attempt to do so, PRO returns an error.

This section explains how to get delivery and pickup options for a consignment, and how to generate consignments and orders from the options a customer selects. Note Access to PRO's delivery and pickup option endpoints requires a SortedHERO license. This component is sold separately to the main SortedPRO product. What Is a Delivery Option? In the context of SortedPRO, a \"delivery option\" for a consignment is a delivery date and time window that that consignment could potentially be delivered on, and a carrier service that could meet that delivery promise. When you request delivery options, you give PRO the details of an as-yet uncreated consignment. PRO then checks its carrier services and returns a list of available delivery slots and their associated carriers, enabling you to present these options to your customer at checkout. PRO always returns a single carrier service for each timeslot. This is generally the cheapest service, unless using the cheapest service would conflict with existing business rules. For example, suppose that you use the Delivery Options endpoint to request delivery options for a particular consignment, and the response indicates the following: Carrier X could deliver the consignment on Monday between 9 and 5 or Tuesday between 9 and 12 Carrier Y could deliver the consignment on Monday between 9 and 12 or Tuesday between 9 and 12 Carrier Z could deliver the consignment on Monday between 9 and 1 or Monday between 1 and 5 In this case, PRO would return five delivery options: Carrier X Monday 9-5 Carrier Y Monday 9-12 Carrier Z Monday 9-1 Carrier Z Monday 1-5 The cheapest option between Carrier X Tuesday 9-12 and Carrier Y Tuesday 9-12 What Is a Pickup Option? Pickup options are similar to delivery options, except they are used to enable PUDO (pick up / drop off) services rather than home delivery. As with delivery options, when you request pickup options, you give PRO the details of an as-yet uncreated consignment. PRO then returns a list of each pickup location that consignment could potentially be delivered to. In turn, each location contains a list of delivery options, generated using the same rules as \"standard\" home delivery options. This enables you to create workflows whereby your customer selects a pickup location and then either selects or is presented with a pickup date/time Section Contents Getting Delivery Options - Explains how to generate delivery options for a consignment Getting Pickup Options - Explains how to generate pickup options for a consignment Selecting Options - Explains how to generate either a consignment or and order from a specific option Note All of the URLs and examples given in this documentation relate to PRO's live production environment.

This page explains how to use the Tracking API to get updates on a consignment's progress. Tracking API Overview PRO's Tracking API has three endpoints: Get Tracking Events - Returns full tracking event information for a specific consignment, including separate details for each leg of a shipment. Get Events Per Package - Returns flattened tracking event information for a specific consignment, broken down by package. Does not take multiple legs into account. Post Tracking Events - Enables carriers to post events directly to PRO. Note The Post Tracking Events endpoint is intended for carrier use only, and is outside the scope of this documentation. What Is a Tracking Event? Tracking events are informational messages returned from carriers that provide details about the status of the consignment. Each tracking event contains the following properties: TimeStamp - The time and date that the tracking event occurred. Code - A unique identifier for the type of tracking event (for example \"Delivered\"). Description - A description of the tracking event. SignedBy - The name of the person who signed for the package (if applicable). Location - The location of the tracking event. PRO integrates with many carriers, and each carrier provides tracking events in different formats. As such, PRO translates all tracking events into a standard format, regardless of carrier service selected. A consignment's current ConsignmentState is derived from these tracking events. For example, a \"Delivered\" tracking event will change the state of the relevant consignment to Delivered . Note For a full list and description of available consignment states, see the Consignment States page. Getting Multi-Leg Tracking Events To call Get Tracking Events , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/tracking/{consignmentReference} . PRO responds with a TrackedPackages array, containing details of all the tracked packages in the consignment. Each package contains an array of Legs , of which each contains tracking Events for that particular leg of the package's journey. Note For full reference information on the Get Tracking Events API, see the API reference . Get Tracking Events Example This example shows a simplified Get Tracking Events response for consignment EC-000-002-4DF . PRO has returned details of one journey leg with a single sample tracking event. Get Tracking Events Response GET https://api.electioapp.com/tracking/EC-000-002-4DF { \"ConsignmentReferenceForAllLegsAssignedByMpd\": \"EC-000-002-4DF\", \"TrackedPackages\": [ { \"PackageReferenceForAllLegsAssignedByMpd\": \"EP-000-034-4DG\", \"Legs\": [ { \"CarrierServiceName\": \"Carrier Service B\", \"Events\": [ { \"TimeStamp\": \"2020-02-11T07:08:11.786733+00:00\", \"Code\": \"Sample\", \"Description\": \"Sample Event\", \"SignedBy\": \"C. Smith\", \"Location\": \"Sample Location\" } ] } ] } ] } Getting Single Leg Tracking Events To call Get Events Per Package , send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/tracking/flattened/{consignmentReference} . Like the Get Tracking Events endpoint, Get Events Per Package returns all tracking events for the specified consignment. However, unlike Get Tracking Events , Get Events Per Package does not break the events returned down into legs. Instead, it returns a list of TrackedPackages , of which each contains a package reference and a list of relevant Events . Note For full reference information on the Get Events Per Package API, see the API reference . Example Get Events Per Package Response This example shows a simplified Get Events Per Package response for consignment EC-000-002-4DF . PRO has returned details of a single sample tracking event. Get Events Per Package Response GET https://api.electioapp.com/tracking/flattened/EC-000-002-4DF { \"ConsignmentReferenceForAllLegsAssignedByMpd\": \"EC-000-002-4DF\", \"TrackedPackages\": [ { \"PackageReferenceForAllLegsAssignedByMpd\": \"EP-000-002-4RE\", \"Events\": [ { \"TimeStamp\": \"2020-02-11T07:08:11.7398573+00:00\", \"Code\": \"DELIVERED\", \"Description\": \"Sample tracking event\", \"SignedBy\": \"P.

This means that we can provide our customers with the ability to ship products with UPS using SortedPRO without the need for any separate customer certification process. This page explains how to configure UPS Ready functionality within PRO. Configuring UPS Ready In order to use UPS Ready functionality within PRO, you will need to register your UPS account number. This step must be completed by Sorted customers as part of the onboarding process, as each customer must accept the terms and conditions of the UPS Technology Agreement (UTA). To register a new UPS account Number within PRO: Open the PRO v1 UI ( Production or Sandbox ) and log in. Select Settings to display the Settings page. Click Manage on the Carrier Services panel to display the Carrier Services page. Click Add Carrier Service to display the Select Carrier Service page. Click Register on the UPS panel to display the UTA. Read the agreement and then click I Agree to display the Contact Information page. Add a Contact Title and Website URL and click the Save button to display the Add Account page Add account and invoice details as necessary then click Add to complete the setup process. Updating Your UPS Details To update your UPS account or invoice details: Return to the Select Carrier Service page ( Settings > Manage Carrier Services > Add Carrier Service ) and click Manage on the UPS panel to display the Add Account page. Make the required changes and then click the Add button to save. Configuring US Domestic EDI Tracking US Domestic Services use an EDI tracking solution (as apposed to API). Therefore, you will need to take some additional steps in order to accept the UPS Technology Agreement (UTA) . The quickest way to onboard UPS EDI services is to sign up for the UPS EDI Click Wrap process. To do so: Contact your local UPS Account Manager, who should submit a request for the process via UPS.com. UPS will respond by sending you an email link. Click the link, log into UPS.com, and approve the UTA by clicking the relevant check box. Alternatively, you can approve the UTA via EDI questionnaire. This is a manual process involving UPS's legal teams, and will take much longer than the EDI Click Wrap process. Once you have approve the UTA, UPS will set up a tracking account via Open Text, their 3rd party provider, and share the relevant SFTP tracking credentials with us. Supported UPS Functions Origins PRO supports UPS shipments originating from Europe and the contiguous United States. APIs The following UPS APIs have been implemented within PRO. License Registration Rating Time in Transit Locator Shipping Tracking (EU origin only. For US Domestic services see the Configuring US Domestic EDI Tracking section) Carrier Services PRO supports the following UPS services for shipments with an EU origin: UPS Standard with signature request UPS Express with signature request UPS Express Saver with signature request UPS Express Plus with signature request Delivery to Access Point – UPS Standard PRO also supports the following UPS services for shipments with a US domestic origin: UPS Next Day Air Early UPS Next Day Air UPS Next Day Air Saver UPS 2nd Day Air UPS 3 Day Select UPS Ground Each US service provides options for Signature Required, Adult Signature Required and Saturday deliveries, as well as delivery to Access Points where applicable."

Previously, PRO enabled you to provide postcode rules in order to exclude a particular carrier service from being allocated to consignments destined for a particular area of the UK. However, international consignments could only be excluded at country level. For example, you could exclude a service from allocation to any consignments destined for the United States, but you were not able to exclude a service from only those consignments destined for Los Angeles. We have now added a ZIP/Postal Code section to the Geographic Availability panel of the Manage Carrier Service Rules page. This section enables you to enter the first three digits of a ZIP code or range of ZIP codes, excluding the service from any consignments destined for those codes. Setting Regional Restrictions To set US regional restrictions for a carrier service: Open the Manage Carrier Service Rules page by going to Settings > Carrier Services > (select a carrier service) > Allocation Rules . Select United States from the Add new restriction menu by typing united into the search box and clicking the United States tile. Select the Regional radio button in the Restriction Type section to display the ZIP/Postal Code fields. Enter either a single ZIP code prefix or a range of ZIP code prefixes: To enter a single code, select the Single radio button and enter a three-digit ZIP prefix into the fields below. For example, to exclude the service from shipping to Jacksonville, FL you would enter 322 . To enter a range, select the Range radio button and enter three-digit ZIP prefixes into both fields. For example, if you were to enter 902 to 906 then the service would be excluded from shipping to Los Angeles vicinity, Inglewood, Santa Monica, Torrance, and Whittier. Click Add to add the new restriction. The restriction appears in the Existing Restrictions list. Note PRO only accepts three-digit ZIP code prefixes when adding geographic service restrictions. If you attempt to enter a different number of digits then PRO displays an error."

Filters enable you to fine-tune the information a report displays by selecting the specific data that you want to view. For example, you might filter a report so that it only takes into account consignments shipped in the last month, rather than taking all consignments into account. Filters You can filter reports either at a report-wide or visual-specific level. Report-wide filters can be selected from the panel on the left-hand side. Filters selected from this panel affect all visuals on the report. Visual filters can be applied by clicking a filter and selecting options from the Filters panel on the right-hand side. Filters selected in this way only apply to the selected visual. Note The list of filters available differs between reports. For information on a report's specific filters, see that report's documentation page in the Using Reports section. You can combine multiple filters if you need to. For example, say you want to see a graph charting how many shipments you sent with DPD and UPS between 30/07/2019 and 30/08/2019. To view this information this you could: Open the Volumes by Carrier report. Use the Date Shipped selector on the left-hand panel to select only consignments shipped between 30/07/2019 and 30/08/2019. The report filters all visuals so that only consignments shipped between those dates are taken into account. Select the Consignments Shipped by Carrier Over Time chart and click the Carrier drop-down on the right-hand Filters panel. A list of available carriers is displayed. Select the carriers that you want to filter the visual by (in this case, UPS and DPD). The report filters the chart so that it only takes into account consignments that were shipped by either UPS or DPD AND meet the existing report filter criteria (that is, they were shipped between 30/07/2019 and 30/08/2019). Note While the report-wide date filter affects all of the report's visuals, the visual-specific carrier filter only applies to the Consignments Shipped by Carrier Over Time chart. To reset a report's filters back to default, click the Reset to Default button on Power BI's toolbar. Filtering Visuals Each visual has various filterable properties. The PRO reports use four types of filter, depending on whether the property in question is a numerical field, text field, or date field: Numerical - Used on numerical fields, enables you to specify a required number range. Basic - Used on text fields, enables you to select simple values (such as individual carrier names) from a list. Advanced - Used on text fields, enables you to select values based on custom selection criteria (such as selecting all carrier services that have names beginning with \"UPS\"). Relative Date - Used on date fields, enables you to specify a required date range. Using Numerical Filters Numerical filters enable you to specify a number range to a numerical field. Once applied, the visual is filtered so that it only takes into account records in which the value of the filtered field meets the criteria you specified. For example, suppose that you are viewing the data table on the Shipped Consignments by Destination Country report, but you are only interested in countries to which you have shipped more than 1000 consignments. You could apply a numerical filter to the Consignments field so that the table only shows country records where the value of Consignments (that is, the total number of consignments shipped to that particular country) was above 1000. To apply a numerical filter to a visual: Ensure that the Filters panel is displayed and select the visual. A list of available filters is displayed Click the drop-down menu for the numerical field you want to filter. Editable filter options are displayed. Select an operator and enter a value. The following operators are available: Is Less Than Is Less Than or Equal To Is Greater Than Is Greater Than or Equal To Is Is Not Is Blank Is Not Blank If required, select either And or Or radio button and repeat step 3 to add a secondary filter. If you do not want to add a secondary filter, leave the value box blank. Click Apply Filter to save your changes. Using the example given earlier, if you wanted to filter the Shipped Consignments by Destination Country report's Consignments field so that only countries to which you have shipped 1000 or more consignments were displayed, you would select Is Greater Than or Equal To from the operator drop-down and enter 1000 into the value box. If you wanted to modify that filter so that only countries to which you have shipped between 1000 and 2000 consignments were displayed, you would select the And radio button and enter Is Less Than or Equal To / 2000 from the secondary filter. Using Basic Filters Basic filters enable you to select individual text values. Once applied, the visual is filtered so that it only takes into account records in which the value of the filtered field meets the criteria you specified. For example, suppose that you are viewing the Delivery Type by Carrier visual on the Delivery Experience report, but you only want to view the delivery types used in shipments by DPD and UPS, rather than your entire suite of carriers. You could use basic filtering to select those two carriers specifically. To apply basic filtering to a visual: Ensure that the Filters panel is displayed and select the visual. A list of available filters is displayed. Click the drop-down menu for the text field you want to filter. Ensure that Basic Filtering is selected from the Filter Type drop-down menu. A list of selectable values is displayed. Use the check boxes to select the values that you want to filter by. Power BI filters the visual automatically. Using Advanced Filters Advanced filters enable you to select all text values that meet certain criteria, rather than selecting individual values themselves. For example, suppose that you are viewing the % of Total Consignments by Carrier Service visual on the Shipping Consignments by Carrier Service report. However, rather than viewing data for all of your carrier services, you only want to view your UPS carrier services. In this case you could use an Advanced filter on the Carrier Service field to filter out all carrier services other than those whose names start with \"UPS\". To apply advanced filtering to a visual: Ensure that the Filters panel is displayed and select the visual. A list of available filters is displayed. Click the drop-down menu for the field you want to filter and select Advanced filtering from the Filter Type drop-down menu. The panel displays filter controls. Select an operator from the Show items when the value: drop-down menu. The following operators are available: Contains Does Not Contain Starts With Does Not Start With Is Is Not Is Blank Is Not Blank Enter a value into the text box. Returning to the previous example, you would need to select Starts with from the drop-down menu and then enter UPS into the text box in order to filter out all carrier services other than those whose names start with \"UPS\" If required, select either And or Or radio button and repeat steps 4 and 5 to enter additional criteria. Click Apply Filter to save your changes. Using Relative Date Filters Relative date filtering is only available on date fields. It enables you to filter visuals by providing a date range that is relative to the current date and time. For example, suppose that you are viewing the Consignments Shipped By Carrier Over Time visual of the Shipped Consignments by Carrier report, but you only want to view data for the late two weeks. You could use a relative date filter on the DateShippedOnly field to select only those consignments that were shipped in the last two weeks. To apply a relative date filter: Ensure that the Filters panel is displayed and select the visual. A list of available filters is displayed. Click the drop-down menu for the field you want to filter and select Relative date filtering from the Filter Type drop-down menu. The panel displays date controls. Enter your filter criteria: Select an operator from the Show items when the value: drop-down menu. The available options are Is In The Last , Is In This , and Is In The Next . Enter a value into the text box. Select a unit from the bottom drop-down box. The available options are Days , Weeks , Calendar Weeks , Months , Calendar Months , Years , and Calendar Years . If required, select the Include Today check box to include the current date in your calculations. Click Apply Filter to save your changes. Using the example given earlier, if you wanted to filter the Consignments Shipped By Carrier Over Time visual of the Shipped Consignments by Carrier report to only display consignments shipped in the last two weeks, you would select Is In The Last , 14 , and Days when filtering the DateShippedOnly field. Visual Options Each visual has a More Options drop-down menu, enabling you to perform additional actions relating to its data. To access the More Options menu, select a visual and click the More Options button in the top-right of the panel. The following options are available: Open Comments Opens Power BI's Comments panel, from where you and your team can leave comments on individual visuals. Note For more information on using Power BI's Comments panel, see the Power BI docs . Export Data Enables you to save a visual's underlying data as a .CSV or .XLSX file. Note For more information on exporting data from Power BI, see the Power BI docs . Show Data Displays a summary of the data that was used to generate that particular visual. Spotlight Highlights the selected visual on the page. Sort (Descending / Ascending / Sort By) Enables you to specify how the visual's data should be sorted. Note Not all options are available to all visuals. For information on a visual's specific options, see that report's documentation page in the Reports section. Viewing Records Some types of visual enable you to click through to view the raw records in the dataset that the visual was generated from. The Using Reports section explains which visuals you can view records for. To view records for a visual, right click on that visual and select View Records from the pop-up menu.

Accessing the App The Sorted PRO reports are published as a self-contained Microsoft Power BI app. The app runs via the web-based Power BI Service - you don't need to install any software to view PRO reports. We provide each PRO customer with one Power BI Pro license, which grants access to view the reports. When you sign up for the service, you'll need to give us the email address of the user you want to assign that license to. We'll then set them up and send them an access link to the reports. Note The access link is unique to an individual user - it won't work for anyone who has not been granted specific access and the relevant Power BI license. Click the access link to open the reports. Alternatively, you can access the reports from within Power BI by clicking Shared with me from the left-hand toolbar and selecting Multi-Company Customer Report from the list of shared reports. Viewing Reports When you open the app, the Traffic Profile report is displayed. To select other reports in the collection, use the tabs at the bottom of the screen. Each PRO report is a collection of data visuals (such as charts, tables, and maps) that gives you an overview of a particular aspect of your shipping performance. For example, the Volumes by Carrier report features a table listing how many consignments and packages each of your carriers has shipped, a pie chart showing the share of your total consignments that shipped with each of your carriers, and a chart showing each carrier's total shipments over time. These three visuals enable you to get a picture of how much of your shipment volume each carrier is handing. Note Sorted takes data confidentiality very seriously. Each Sorted customer can only use the app to view their own organisation's data. Focus mode Power BI's Focus mode enables you to expand a visual or tile to see more detail. All other visuals on the report are temporarily hidden. To open a visual in Focus mode, hover your mouse pointer over it and click the Focus Mode button. To return to the full report when in Focus mode, click the Back to Report button. Next Steps For an overview of filters and visual options, see the Filters and Options page.

It comprises a table listing consignment and packages data, and two bar charts: Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight and Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight . Note In the context of PRO, the term \"consignment\" refers to a collection of one or more packages that are shipped from the same origin address, to the same destination address, on behalf of the same Sorted customer, using the same carrier service, on the same day. A package is an item or a collection of items, wrapped or contained together for shipment. Each package can contain one or more items. As an example, suppose that a clothing retailer has received a customer order for a necklace, a bracelet, a coat, and a hat. As the necklace and bracelet are both physically small, the retailer elects to ship them in the same package. As such, this sales order would break down to: Four items - The necklace, the bracelet, the coat, and the hat. Three packages - One containing the necklace and bracelet, one containing the coat, and one containing the hat. A single consignment corresponding to everything on the order. Report Filters The Traffic Profile report offers the following report-wide filters: Date Manifested - enables you to select consignments that were manifested within a given date range. Company - where applicable, enables you to select consignments that were manifested by a particular company within your group. You can select multiple companies if required. Shipping Location - where applicable, enables you to select consignments that were manifested from a particular shipping location. Carrier - enables you to select consignments that were manifested to a particular carrier. Carrier Service - enables you to select consignments that were manifested to a particular carrier service. Delivery Type - enables you to select consignments that were used a particular delivery type (i.e. Delivery or Click and Collect ). Consignments Table The consignment data table visual lists the following information for each of your companies (with any report filters taken into account): Consignments - Number of consignments manifested. Packages - Number of packages manifested. Average Packages Per Consignment Average Weight, KG - The average weight, in kilograms, of the consignments shipped. Average Weight, Volumetric - The average volumetric weight of the consignments shipped. Visual Filters The consignment data table enables you to filter the companies displayed. For example, if you were to set an Average Packages Per Consignment filter of less than 1.5 packages, then any companies shipping an average of 1.51 or more packages per consignment would be excluded. The following filters are available: Average Packages Per Consignment ( Numerical ) - enables you to filter by the average number of packages shipped in each consignment. Consignments ( Numerical ) Packages ( Numerical ) Average Weight, KG ( Numerical ) Average Weight, Volumetric ( Numerical ) Company ( Basic and Advanced ) More Options The following options are available from the More Options menu: Open Comments Export Data Show Data Spotlight Sort Descending Sort Ascending Sort by Company / Consignments / Packages / Average Packages per Consignment / Avg Weight, Kg / Avg Weight, Volumetric Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight The Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight chart displays the weight distribution of your manifested consignments. In the example above, the company in question has shipped 53,324 consignments that were between 0 and 4.75kg in weight, 10,306 parcels that were between 4.76 and 9.52 kg in weight, and so on. Visual Filters The Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight chart's Kilograms filter is a ( Numerical ) filter that enables you to limit the consignment weights displayed. For example, if you were to set the filter to is greater than or equal 10 , then the chart would only display data for those consignments with an absolute weight of 10kg or above. More Options The following options are available from the More Options menu: Open Comments Export Data Show Data Spotlight Viewing Data The Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight chart's Show Data option displays a table of absolute weights in kilograms (rounded to the nearest 10 grams), and a count of how many consignments met each weight. For example, the sample image shows that the customer shipped 266 consignments with a total weight of 0.14 kg (i.e. 140 grams), and 39 consignments with a total weight of 0.25 kg (250 grams). Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight The Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight chart displays the volumetric weight distribution of your manifested consignments. Note Volumetric weight is a method of estimating a parcel's weight using its dimensions. It is usually calculated as the parcel's length x weight x height (all in cm) / 5000, although exact calculations can vary between carriers. For example, a 10cm cube would have a volumetric weight of 10 x 10 x 10 / 5000 = 0.2 kg In the example above, the company in question has shipped 65,091 consignments that were between 0 and 9.26kg in volumetric weight, 7,550 parcels that were between 9.72 and 18.53 kg in volumetric weight, and so on.

In the context of SortedPRO, allocation is the process of selecting the carrier service that will deliver the packages that make up the consignment. PRO allocates all packages in a consignment together, as carriers expect that all packages in a consignment will ship on the same service. PRO has multiple allocation API endpoints, giving you the flexibility to pass instructions, hints or filtering criteria when allocating. PRO's allocation endpoints consider the following factors when selecting a service: The capabilities of the carrier services. Any custom allocation rules you may have configured in PRO. Any allocation tags you may have supplied when the consignment was created. This page explains the following endpoints: Allocate Using Default Rules - Allocates the consignment using pre-configured default rules. Allocate Consignment With Service Group - Allocates the consignment to the cheapest carrier service in the specified Carrier Service Group. Allocate With Carrier Service - Allocates the consignment to the specified carrier service. Once allocated, the consignment's status is updated to Allocated , enabling you to retrieve its package labels and (where applicable) customs documentation. This section of the site explains the circumstances in which you might choose to use each allocation endpoint, and gives worked examples. Note For a full user guide on allocating consignments in PRO, see the Allocating Consignments section. The Allocation Summary Response All allocation endpoints return an Allocation Summary, either singularly or (where multiple consignments have been allocated at once) in an array. The Allocation Summary contains links to the consignment resource that was allocated, a summary of the carrier service that the consignment was allocated to, a link to the relevant package labels, and a ConsignmentLegs array indicating how many legs the delivery will need. In the example, a consignment with a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MMA has been allocated to a (dummy) carrier service called Carrier X Next Day Super . Tip Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of available carrier services on a per-consignment basis, no matter which allocation endpoint you use in your integration.

Consignments are created using the Create Consignment endpoint, which takes information about new consignments, adds them to the database, and returns a link to the newly-created consignment, including its {consignmentReference} . A newly created consignment has a {consignmentState} of Unallocated . As a minimum, the Create Consignments endpoint requires you to send package weights and dimensions, origin address, and destination address data. Note For full reference information on the Create Consignment endpoint, see the Create Consignment page of the API reference. For a user guide explaining the Create Consignment endpoint, see the Creating New Consignments page. Create Consignments Example These examples show the creation of a fairly standard consignment. In this case, we have an outbound consignment comprising a single package with a single item inside it. After receiving the request, PRO returns a {consignmentReference} of EC-000-05B-MMA . Many of PRO's functions require you to provide a {consignmentReference} as a parameter. Therefore, you should store the {consignmentReference} for later use.

The Pickup Options endpoint takes the details of an as-yet uncreated consignment and returns available pickup options. At a minimum, PRO requires you to send the following data in order to receive pickup options for a potential consignment: Distance - The maximum distance from the destination address that you want to receive results for. Max Results - The maximum number of results that you want to receive. This should be a value between one and 50. Package Information Origin Address Destination Address The Pickup Options endpoint returns a {Locations} array containing details of each pickup location that can accept your consignment. PRO provides the location's full address, distance from destination address, latitude / longitude, and opening and closing times, enabling you to surface this information at checkout so that your customers can choose a convenient option. Each {Location} object contains a {DeliveryOptions} array listing the delivery promises available to that location for the proposed consignment. Note For full reference information on the Pickup Options endpoint, see the Pickup Options page of the API reference. For a user guide on pickup options, see the Getting Pickup Options page.

These details form a delivery promise for a consignment. PRO then recommends a carrier service that can meet the delivery promise, the delivery cost, and the required shipping date, completing the data for each delivery option. The Delivery Options endpoint takes the details of the (as yet uncreated) consignment. As a minimum, PRO requires you to send package, origin address and destination address data in order to return delivery options. The endpoint returns an array of {DeliveryOptions} objects. Each {DeliveryOptions} object contains details of a delivery option that can be used to take a consignment with the details you passed in the request. PRO always returns the cheapest carrier service for each delivery promise, unless using the cheapest service would conflict with existing business rules. If you do not provide a DeliveryDate in the request, then PRO returns delivery options for a maximum of fourteen days from the current date. If you provide a DeliveryDate , then PRO provides options up to and including the supplied date. The delivery options available for a given consignment can change over time. This is primarily due to differing carrier collection times at each shipping location. Note For full reference information on the Delivery Options endpoint, see the Delivery Options page of the API reference. For a user guide on PRO delivery options, see the Using Delivery and Pickup Options section. Get Delivery Options Example The example shows a request to get delivery options for a fairly standard consignment.

Duties are generally based on the value of the goods (ad valorem duties), some other factor such as weight or quantity (specific duties), or a combination of value and other factors (compound duties) ​​​​Encoding ​​​A process of changing a datastream into a different format, such as a label image as ZPL or a Base64 string ​​​​​Endpoint ​​​​One end of a channel or journey. For example, data may be submitted to an API endpoint, or a Collection Endpoint is where a shipment is collected from by the Carrier ​​EoD​​ ​End of Day - used by both Retailers and Carriers to mark the final cut off point of a working day​​ EORI Number An Economic Operators Registration and Identification number. Used as an identifier for businesses and people when exchanging information with customs officials, for example when lodging a customs declaration. Event (REACT) An object containing details of a change in certain shipment properties. For example, if a tracking file received from a carrier caused a particular shipment's status to change, the details of that change would be recorded as an event F - N Field Description ​​​FTP / sFTP ​​​File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard Internet protocol for transmitting files between computers on the Internet over TCP/IP connections. sFTP is a more secure variant of this protocol, and is preferred Girth​​ ​The maximum circumference of a parcel = (2 x width) + (2 x height)​​ Gross Weight​​​​ ​The full weight of a shipment, including goods and packaging​​​ Hazardous Material Usually classed under dangerous goods, hazardous materials are defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation in accordance with the Federal Hazardous Material Law. A substance or material may be designated as hazardous if the transportation of the material in a particular amount and form poses an unreasonable risk to health and safety or property. Hazardous material may include: an explosive, radioactive material, etiologic agent, flammable or combustible liquid or solid, poison, oxidizing or corrosive material, and compressed gas​​​​ Hub A Hub is a sorting facility where shipments are sorted and distributed to other Hubs or depot locations ​​​​Import Duty​ ​​Import duty is applied by a country's customs. Import duty is calculated based upon the tariff code of each product contained within the shipment. Each country sets varying levels of import duty depending on the product. Exemptions do apply to certain products and types of shipments. For example, gifts and personal effects are often exempt from import duty if they are under a certain value threshold​​​ Inbound A shipment that is going back to the retailer rather than the purchaser. Usually indicates a 'Return' service IOSS Number An Import One-Stop Shop number. The Import One-Stop Shop is an electronic portal enabling suppliers selling imported goods to buyers in the EU to collect, declare and pay VAT to the relevant tax authorities, instead of making the buyer pay the VAT at the moment the goods are imported into the EU. The IOSS number is a user number for this system. ​Item​​​ ​A distinct piece collected by a Picker in a warehouse to fulfil and order. A number of items may be consolidated into one order, which may comprise of one or more packages. If a number of packages that are using the same service to the same recipient are consolidated together, they may be described as a consignment Label Printed information that is affixed to a package. The label must be visible, legible where required, and with barcodes that can be read according to the Carrier's requirements (and machinery). SortedPRO can use ZPL and PDF​ formats, although ZPL is preferred to be received/sent due to its smaller data size. ​Labels tend to come in standard sizes, with the most common being 6\" x 4\" (152.4mm x 101.6mm). Labels may also be 8\" x 4\" (203.2mm x 101.6mm), or variants of standard paper sizes (A4/5/6, where each increment is half the size of the previous)​​​ Manifest A manifest is an electronic document containing shipment data that is exchanged between business partners. For example, a manifest file may be sent at the EoD from SortedPRO to a Carrier, and this file may contain details on many shipments. For API files, shipments may also be manifested individually, usually when a label is created ​​​Metadata ​​Not all the data that a Client needs to pass to a carrier may map directly to an existing SortedPRO field. As a result, clients can add custom data (known as metadata) to a given shipment, which can then be passed on to Sorted. It is not normally processed by PRO Net Weight The weight of an item without packaging or container. Also applies to the contents of a shipping container, truck or van O - S Field Description Order A collection of packages that is to be transported to the same destination and on behalf of the same customer On Demand Services that are offered to the recipient with significant customisation. These can apply to where the package is collected from and delivered to, or when the package is delivered Package An item or a collection of items, wrapped or contained together for shipment. Each package can contain one or more items Paperless ​The creation and submission of customs documents to the carrier (and customs agency) electronically, rather than by a form attached to the shipment Pickup Option A combination of a PUDO (pickup/drop-off) location that a consignment could potentially be delivered to, a delivery date and time window that it could be delivered to that location on, and a carrier service that could meet that delivery promise ​​POD ​ ​​Proof of Delivery. A copy (usually electronic) of a signature confirming that the shipment has been delivered​​ ​​Point of​ Origin​​ ​Used in customs forms, and usually the origin country of the shipment or package​​​​ ​PUDO​ ​Pick Up Drop Off - services where a recipient can request delivery to a location other than their address, such as a locker or a shop (outbound Pick Up). The Drop Off refers to the inbound service - the reverse direction - when a customer returns a p​​​ackage via a shop or locker​ Quota The quantity of goods of a specific kind or cost that a country permits to be imported without restriction or imposition of additional duties​​​​ REACT ​​An enhanced tracking product for clients offered by Sorted Group​​ Registering a Shipment (REACT) The process of recording a shipment's details, enabling REACT to track it ​Return​​​ ​​​​​A shipment (all or in part) that is sent back to the consignor. This may be due to faulty goods, or the contract between the retailer and the customer (e.g. \"return if not wanted\") ​Rate​​ ​​​The cost applied by a carrier to pick up and deliver a shipment or package. Typically, rates are either set by a file, which lists costs, destinations and any surcharges, or requested via an API endpoint ​Shipment​​​ ​​​​​A shipment is a user-defined unit containing goods (single or multiple units) that requires transportation from one location to another. A colleciton of goods becomes a shipment when it leaves the consignor's location. A shipment is complete when it arrives at the consignee's destination.​​ Shipment ID (REACT) A REACT-generated unique identifier for a particular shipment that can be used throughout REACT's APIs Shipment State (REACT) A shipment's current status, updated as shipment events occur Shipment Filter (REACT) A list of shipment states, calculated events, and tags that acts as a webhook trigger. When a shipment meets any of these criteria, any webhooks configured for that filter will deploy Shipment Type (REACT) For example, delivery, return, pick up, drop off, combined drop off / pick up, or return drop off Shipping Location A pre-set address used by your organisation as an origin for outbound consignments and a destination for inbound consignments State Label (REACT) A custom snippet of text that can be used in place of a standard shipment state name. Shipment state labels enable you to explain shipment states in your own brand tone of voice, using language that your customers will understand. For example, you might choose to rename \"Out for Delivery\" to \"On Its Way!\", or similar ​​​​Surcharge ​​​A shipment surcharge is an additional charge that is applied to the base cost of a shipment. The most common surcharge applied in transportation is a fuel surcharge supplement, which varies in line with global fuel costs​​​​, and is usually specified as a percentage of the base cost. Fixed surcharges can also be applied if there are additional costs for the carrier, such as London Congestion Charges, or delivery to remote areas T - Z Field Description Tag (REACT) An identifier that enables you to associate related shipments (such as all shipments of a particular product, or all shipments of products on special offer) with each other. Tags can be used in conjunction with webhooks to fine-tune the information REACT sends to you ​​Tracking​​​ ​In the carrier world, tracking is the following of a given shipment from collection to delivery (or return), usually as a set of values (time, location and status). This may be presented as a file (the preferred approach), or via an API call ​​​​Tracking Event​ ​A change in tracking status of a parcel, such as 'Delivered', or 'Returned to Sender' Tracking Page (REACT) In REACT, a customisable microsite, hosted by Sorted, that displays status and event information about an individual shipment. Your customers can track their order by visiting the link that corresponds to their shipment ​​​​Tracking Reference ​A tracking number is the unique ID assigned to shipments sent by courier. Tracking numbers enable you to track shipments online and serve as a single reference number when communicating with the carrier about a shipment​. They are usually printed on a shipping label, both in human readable and barcode formats​​​​​ ​​Transit Time​​ The time taken between collection and delivery of a given shipment, usually expressed in days. With international shipping, this may be expressed as a range, i.e. 3 to 5 days Undeliverable ​​​When a shipment cannot be delivered to a recipient or a location specified by a recipient. For example, the location may be closed or inaccessible ​​Undelivered​ ​The tracking status of a shipment that cannot be delivered to a recipient, or location specified by a recipient​​ ​URL ​​​Uniform Resource Locator. The address of a webpage Webhook An automated message sent whenever a particular event occurs. In REACT, webhooks are triggered by changes in shipment state. When a shipment assumes a selected state, the webhook deploys.

To manifest a consignment, use the Manifest Consignments endpoint. In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifest\" refers to advising the carrier of all the consignments/packages to be collected from the shipper. The Manifest Consignments endpoint can be used to manifest multiple consignments at once. The request should contain an array of {consignmentReference} s, corresponding to the consignments to be manifested. All the consignments you provide in the request should be in a state of either Allocated or Manifest Failed . If you attempt to manifest a consignment that is not in one of these states then PRO returns an error. Once PRO has received the request and attempted to manifest the consignments, the Manifest Consignments endpoint returns an array of messages indicating whether each individual consignment was successfully manifested or not. For full reference information on the Manifest Consignments endpoint, see the Manifest Consignments page of the API Reference. Examples The example shows a request to manifest three consignments. The response indicates that all three consignments were successfully manifested."

To manifest a consignment, use the Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint. In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting the consignment data to carriers. The Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint enables you to use a query to select consignments to be manifested. Once PRO has added those consignments to a manifest and queued the data to be sent, the Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint returns a Message detailing how many consignments met the terms of the query, how many of those consignments were successfully queued, and how many could not be queued. Note For full reference information on the Manifest Consignments From Query endpoint, see the Manifest Consignments From Query page of the API Reference. For a user guide on manifesting consignments, see the Manifesting Consignments page. Manifest Consignments From Query Example The example shows a request to manifest all consignments that are allocated to Carrier X, shipping from a location with the ShippingLocationReference Location1 , and have already had their labels printed. The response indicates that PRO found 10 consignments meeting these criteria, and that all 10 were successfully queued for manifest.

This array can be used to record additional data about the consignment in custom fields. The MetaData array has two parts - the KeyValue and the metadata values. The KeyValue is the name of the property, while the metadata values are the data items themselves. The fields that should be used to store this data varies depending on the data types being stored. Metadata values can be stored in the following fields: StringValue - used to store data as a string. IntValue - used to store data as an integer. DecimalValue - used to store data as a decimal. DateTimeValue - used to store data as a DateTimeOffset. BoolValue - used to store data as a Boolean (true/false). Each metadata object can contain multiple data items, but can only contain one data item of each type. For example, a MetaData array containing a StringValue and a BoolValue would be valid, but a MetaData array containing two StringValue keys would not. Metadata Example The example shows a MetaData array that is being used to store a consignment's picking data. The StringValue property is being used to record the name of the picker, and the DateTimeValue is being used to record the date and time that the consignment was picked. Example MetaData array Copy \"MetaData\": [ { \"KeyValue\": \"Picked_On\", \"StringValue\": \"Josh Allen\", \"DateTimeValue\": \"2019-06-04T00:00:00+01:00\" } ]"

The Pack Order endpoint enables you to group those items on an order that share an origin and are to be shipped together, generating a shippable consignment for them. You will need to send a Pack Order request for each consignment that you want to create from the order. To make a Pack Order request, send a GET request to https://api.electioapp.com/orders/{orderReference}/pack . The body of the request can contain various properties that are used when creating the consignment, but at a minimum should contain the {orderReference} of the associated order and details of at least one {package} containing at least one {item} from the order. The items and packages listed make up the consignment. Once SortedPRO has received a Pack Order request, it creates the consignment and returns the relevant {consignmentReference} . Note For full reference information on the Pack Order endpoint, see the Pack Order page of the API reference. For a user guide on orders in PRO, see the Managing Orders section. Pack Order Example The example shows a Pack Order request to create a consignment with one package containing a single item from order EO-000-002-0TT .

When you make a request to allocate multiple shipments simultaneously, PRO queues those shipments to be allocated at a later time rather than allocating them straight away. This helps to optimise performance. PRO then allocates queued shipments via an automated background process. Note If you only need to allocate a single shipment, you should use one of PRO's allocation endpoints for individual shipments ( Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service , Allocate Shipment with Service Group and Allocate Shipment with Virtual Service ) rather than a bulk allocation endpoint. Using an individual endpoint means that the shipment is allocated straight away."

For example, suppose that you choose to use shipment groups to represent carrier trailers, so that you can manifest an entire trailer of shipments at once. To this end, you create a shipment group with a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM to represent Carrier X's daily afternoon collection. The first time you create this group, the group has a version number of 1 . You add the relevant shipments to the group, manifest them using the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint as they are picked up, and then close the shipment group. The following day, you create a new shipment group for that day's collection. As before, you use a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM . This time, however, PRO responds with a version number of 2 , as this is the second time that that custom_reference has been used. You can now use the version number to point to the shipment group you want. CarrierX-PM version 1 points to the original (now closed) shipment group, while CarrierX-PM version 2 points to the new group. Note that both groups also have unique (PRO-generated) references ."

Tagged shipments can only be allocated to those carrier services that have a matching tag. You can still allocate untagged shipments to a carrier service that has tags. To associate tags with carrier services, use the Settings > Carrier Services > [select carrier service] > Allocation Rules > Allocation Filtering Tags panel of the SortedPRO UI. For example, a retailer might use the UI to add a Flammables tag to all the carrier services that they wanted to use for flammable products. They would then add the Flammables tag to all consignments containing flammable products. PRO would only allocate those consignments tagged as Flammables to a consignment in the pre-approved Flammables list. Scenarios Suppose that you set your carrier services up in the following way: You tag Carrier Service A with Alcohol You tag Carrier Service B with Flammables You tag Carrier Service C with Alcohol and Flammables You tag Carrier Service D with Oil You don't add any tags to Carrier Service E This configuration would produce the following results: Consignment with no tags - A B C D and E are returned Consignment tagged with Alcohol - A and C are returned Consignment tagged with Flammables - B and C are returned Consignment tagged with Alcohol and Flammables - C is returned Consignment tagged with Alcohol , Flammables , and Oil - No services are returned Tags Example The example shows a tags property for a consignment that contains flammable materials, oil and alcohol.

When allocating shipments, PRO uses shipping modes to determine the most appropriate eligible carrier service to allocate the shipment to at that particular point in time. Configuring shipping modes can help you to deal with carrier shipping volume restrictions (i.e. during peak hours) and avoid penalties for insufficient trailer fills without the need for manual intervention. Shipping modes are closely related to shipping rules, which are also used during the allocation process as a means of selecting a carrier service. It's important to know the difference between shipping rules and shipping modes: Shipping rules are business rules that determine which of your enabled carrier services would be eligible to take a shipment. For example, you could use shipping rules to set a condition that \"Only carrier services A, B, and, D can take shipments with a value of over £100\" Shipping modes are patterns that determine which eligible carrier services the shipment will be allocated to. For example, a shipping mode might be used to configure allocation limits on your carrier services, with PRO allocating to the cheapest service that has not reached its limit. Continuing from the example above, PRO could combine the shipping rule and shipping mode effectively say \"From the pool of eligible carrier services (A,B, and D), A has reached its daily allocation limit, B would cost £10 to ship the goods, and D would cost £5 to ship the goods. Therefore, allocate the shipment to carrier service D. \" PRO shipping modes enable you to specify allocation limits with custom time ranges, which can be applied to both carrier services and shipping locations."

PRO shipment rules exist as a pre-defined set of specifications, based on shipment parameters and attributes. These specifications are then linked to carrier services and shipping locations to create a rule. A rule can either include shipments (e.g. \"The linked carrier services are available when a shipment's weight is between 10 and 15 kg\") or exclude shipments (e.g. \"The linked carrier services are available unless a shipment's weight is between 10 and 15 kg\"). When PRO allocates a shipment, it examines the rules linked to each of its carrier services and excludes any services whose linked rulesets would prevent that service from taking the shipment. Some use cases for shipment rules include: Always shipping high-value items with a particular carrier service. Only using specific carrier services to ship to a particular country or group of countries. Never using a particular carrier service from a particular shipping location (for example, due to high shipping costs or previous customer service issues)."

They can help to make your workflows more efficient, reducing steps in the manifest process and enabling you to attach document data to a shipment directly. Note PRO's paperless document functionality should not be confused with PRO's customs documents functionality. Paperless documents are added to the shipment before allocation and transmitted as part of that shipment's data, while customs documents are generated post-allocation and are intended to be printed before dispatch. For more information on working with customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Not all carriers support paperless trade. You can add paperless documents to an unallocated shipment via the Add Paperless Document endpoint. As a minimum, Add Paperless Document requests should include the document's file_format , document_type , and file_content (as a base64-encoded byte array). You can also add expiration and usage data if required. Once it has received the request, PRO attaches the document to the specified shipment and returns a unique reference for the paperless document. You can use this reference to retrieve details of the paperless document (via the Get Paperless Document endpoint), or delete the paperless document entirely (via the Remove Paperless Document endpoint). Note For full reference information on the Add Paperless Document endpoint, see the PRO v2 API Reference .

Tip In PRO, carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all shipments involving dangerous items. Like other allocation endpoints, Allocate Shipments with Service Groups allocates based on your organisation's custom allocation rules. PRO enables you to configure custom allocation rules for individual carrier services - such as valid package dimensions, maximum shipment value, and geographical availability - via the UI. The Allocate Shipments with Service Groups endpoint can be used to allocate multiple shipments simultaneously. The request body should contain an array of one or more shipment {reference} s to be allocated. Once the request is received, SortedPRO queues all of the listed shipments for allocation to the cheapest eligible carrier within the service group, based on your default rules. The system then returns an Allocate Shipments Response. Note For full reference information on the Allocate Shipments with Service Group endpoint, see the Allocate Shipments with Service Group section of the API reference. For a user guide on allocating within carrier service groups, see the Allocating Within a Carrier Service Group section of the PRO API User Guide. For a user guide on configuring carrier service groups, see the Managing Carrier Service Groups section of the Sorted Admin Portal User Guide.

Once it has received the Create Quote request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes a summary of the shipment details submitted, a list of quote objects, and a list of excluded_services (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Note For full reference information on the Create Quote endpoint, see the Create Quote page of the API reference.

Tip In PRO, carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all shipments involving dangerous items. Once it has received the Create Quote by Service Group request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes a summary of the shipment details submitted, a list of quote objects, and a list of excluded_services (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Note For full reference information on the Create Quote by Service Group endpoint, see the Create Quote by Service Group page of the API reference.

Shipments are created using the Create Shipment endpoint, which takes information about new shipments, adds them to the database, and returns a link to the newly-created shipment, including its {reference} . A newly created shipment has a {state} of unallocated . As a minimum, the Create Shipments endpoint requires you to send details of the contents of the shipment and its origin and destination addresses. You must also specify whether the shipment is on_demand (i.e. will require an ad-hoc carrier collection to be booked) or scheduled (i.e. will be picked up as part of a regularly scheduled carrier collection). Note For full reference information on the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Create Shipment page of the API reference. For a user guide explaining the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Creating Shipments page. Create Shipments Example This example shows the creation of a fairly standard shipment. In this case, we have an outbound shipment comprising a single package. After receiving the request, PRO returns a shipment {reference} of sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . Many of PRO's functions require you to provide this shipment {reference} as a parameter.

You can retrieve customs documentation via the Get Customs Documents endpoint. The Get Customs Documents endpoint takes a shipment {reference} as a path parameter. If CN22/CN23 or commercial invoice documents exist for the specified shipment, then PRO returns these documents as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to a PDF document. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the documents. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Documents endpoint, see the Get Customs Documents page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving customs documents and commercial invoices in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Get Customs Documents Example This example shows a Get Customs Documents response for shipment sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 . PRO has returned a CN22 document.

You can retrieve these delivery labels via the Get Labels endpoint. The Get Labels endpoint takes shipment {reference} , {contentType} , and {dpi} as path parameters, where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to get labels for, {contentType} is an optional property indicating the file format required (either PDF or ZPL), and {dpi} an optional property indicating is the resolution required. PRO returns all package labels associated with that shipment as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to the format and resolution requested. Note For full reference information on the Get Labels endpoint, see the Get Labels page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving labels in PRO, see the Getting Labels page. Get Labels Example The example shows a request to get PDF labels for a shipment with a {reference} of sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 . The file data in the response has been truncated for clarity. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the label.

The Manifest Shipment endpoint enables you to manifest an individual shipment. Once PRO has received the request, it attempts to manifest the specified shipment and returns a manifest_result containing a unique reference for the manifest item and details of the carrier and service that the shipment was manifested with. Caution Every successful request to a manifest endpoint results in data being transmitted to the carrier. Therefore, Sorted strongly advise that manifesting of scheduled shipments is aligned with the carrier collection times from the warehouse.

This page explains how to add paperless documents to a shipment, retrieve a shipment's paperless documents, and remove a paperless document from a shipment. What are Paperless Documents? Paperless documents are intended to make your workflows more efficient. You can upload paperless documents using the Add Paperless Documents endpoint. You can only add paperless documents to an unallocated shipment. Caution Not all carriers support paperless trade. PRO supports the following paperless document types: Commercial invoice documents. Certificates of origin. NAFTA certificates of origin. Pro-forma invoices. Authorisation forms. Export documents. Export licences. Import permits. Power of attorney documents. Packing lists. Shipper's export (SED) documents. Letters of instruction. Customs declarations. Air waybills. Invoices. Documents must be uploaded as an image in one of PRO's supported formats (PDF, PNG, JPG or GIF), and must be less than 5MB in size. For larger documents you may need to optimise your files (for example, removing fonts and embedded data from a PDF or reducing quality on a JPG) to bring your files under the size limit. Note PRO's paperless document functionality should not be confused with PRO's customs documents functionality. Paperless documents are added to the shipment before allocation and transmitted as part of that shipment's data, while customs documents are generated post-allocation and are intended to be printed before dispatch. For more information on working with customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Adding Paperless Documents to Shipments The Add Paperless Document endpoint enables you to add paperless documents to an existing unallocated shipment. To call Add Paperless Document , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/{reference} , where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to add the document to. Note It is only possible to add a paperless document to a shipment prior to allocation (i.e. when the shipment is in a state of either unallocated or allocation_failed ). If you attempt to add a paperless document to an allocated shipment then PRO returns an error. The body of the request should contain the following information: A file_format property indicating the format of the file being uploaded. A document_type property indicating the type of document being uploaded. This must be a valid PRO paperless document type. See the Shipments data contract for a list of valid document types. A file_content property containing the document file itself as a base64-encoded byte array. Optionally, the request body can also include: An expiration property indicating the date and time that the document expires. A usage property indicating the document's intended usage. If provided, this property must contain a valid PRO paperless_document_usage value. See the Shipments data contract for a list of valid document usages. If this property is not provided then PRO defaults to a usage of electronic_trade for the document. Once it has received the request, PRO attaches the document to the specified shipment and returns a unique reference for the paperless document. Example Add Paperless Document Call The example shows a successful request to add a commercial_invoice paperless document to shipment sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 .

This section explains how to configure allocation rules that PRO can use when selecting carrier services, and the various methods you can use to allocate shipments to those services. What Is Allocation? In the context of SortedPRO, allocation is the process of selecting the carrier service that will be used to deliver a shipment. Allocation is a key part of all PRO workflows, as a shipment cannot be shipped if it has not previously been allocated to a suitable carrier service. Note You can only allocate shipments that are in a {state} of either unallocated or allocation_failed . If you attempt to allocate a shipment that is not in one of those states, then PRO returns an error. To allocate shipments in PRO, you'll need to call one of PRO's allocation endpoints. You can specify a carrier service or service group to allocate to, allocate based on a quote you received, or have PRO select the cheapest eligible carrier service for you. PRO uses pre-defined allocation rules to ensure that your shipment is allocated to a suitable carrier service. PRO offers the following allocation endpoints: Allocate Shipment https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate - Allocates a single shipment using your default allocation rules. Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate/service/{service_ref} - Allocates a single shipment with a specific carrier service. Allocate with Carrier Service https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocation/service - Allocates multiple shipments with a specific carrier service. Allocate Shipment with Service Group https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate/service_group/{group_ref} - Allocates a single shipment with a carrier service from a specific carrier service group. Allocate with Service Group https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocation/service_group - Allocates multiple shipments with a carrier service from a specific carrier service group. The action PRO takes once the allocation request is received depends on the type of endpoint you used. If you used an endpoint that allocates individual shipments, then PRO allocates the shipment immediately and returns an Allocation Summary listing details of the allocation, such as prices, dates and tracking information. However, if you used an endpoint that can allocate multiple shipments at once, then PRO queues the shipments for allocation at a later time in order to maintain performance. When PRO queues shipments, it returns an Allocate Shipments Result confirming the shipments that were queued. Note PRO admins can use the UI to activate and deactivate carrier services from the allocation pool. For more information on activating and deactivating carrier services, see the Viewing Carrier Services section of the Sorted Admin Portal Guide. When a shipment is allocated to a carrier service, its status changes to allocated , enabling you to retrieve its package labels and (where applicable) customs documentation. Tip When you allocate an on-demand shipment, PRO automatically books a collection as a background process. You do not need to specify on_demand booking details manually. Selecting a Carrier Service Most allocation endpoints require PRO to select a carrier service from a range of potential options. PRO uses the following process to select carrier services: Who can meet the request type? - First, PRO creates a pool of carrier services that could potentially meet the terms of the allocation request. The results returned by this step depend heavily on the allocation endpoint used. For example, an Allocate with Service Group request limits PRO to only those shipments in a particular service group, whereas an Allocate Shipment request does not limit the pool of available services in itself and could potentially include any carrier service. Who can deliver? - Next, PRO takes the details of the shipment into account, eliminating any carrier services that could not take the shipment (for example, because they do not ship to the delivery address or they could meet any specified shipping and delivery dates). Who meets the shipping rules? - Next, PRO creates a final shortlist of carrier services by eliminating any services that do not meet your organisation's allocation rules. Who meets the selected shipping mode? - Finally, PRO uses shipping modes to determine which of the remaining carrier services the shipment should be allocated to. By default, PRO uses a \"cheapest carrier\" shipping mode, in which the system allocates the shipment to the cheapest carrier service that meets the allocation rules. Note Certain carriers may specify their own rules in order to filter out which shipments can be allocated to a particular service. For example, some carriers require a package description when shipping internationally, and will not allow their services to be allocated to a international shipment that does not have the correct description. PRO automatically takes these rules into account when allocating shipments. What Is a Shipping Rule? When you make an allocation request, PRO uses its shipping rules to ascertain which carrier services are \"eligible\" to take the shipments in question and which are not. PRO shipment rules exist as a pre-defined set of specifications, based on shipment parameters and attributes. These specifications are then linked to carrier services and shipping locations to create a rule. A rule can either include shipments (e.g. \"The linked carrier services are available when a shipment's weight is between 10 and 15 kg\") or exclude shipments (e.g. \"The linked carrier services are available unless a shipment's weight is between 10 and 15 kg\"). When PRO allocates a shipment, it examines the rules linked to each of its carrier services and excludes any services whose linked rulesets would prevent that service from taking the shipment. Some use cases for shipment rules include: Always shipping high-value items with a particular carrier service. Only using specific carrier services to ship to a particular country or group of countries. Never using a particular carrier service from a particular shipping location (for example, due to high shipping costs or previous customer service issues). Note For more information on configuring and using shipping rules, see the Managing Shipping Rules page of the UI user guide. What Is a Shipping Mode? In PRO, a shipping mode is a preconfigured shipping pattern. When allocating shipments, PRO uses shipping modes to determine the most appropriate eligible carrier service to allocate the shipment to at that particular point in time. Configuring shipping modes can help you to deal with carrier shipping volume restrictions (i.e. during peak hours) and avoid penalties for insufficient trailer fills without the need for manual intervention. Shipping modes are closely related to shipping rules, which are also used during the allocation process as a means of selecting a carrier service. It's important to know the difference between shipping rules and shipping modes: Shipping rules are business rules that determine which of your enabled carrier services would be eligible to take a shipment. For example, you could use shipping rules to set a condition that \"Only carrier services A, B, and, D can take shipments with a value of over £100\" Shipping modes are patterns that determine which eligible carrier services the shipment will be allocated to. For example, a shipping mode might be used to configure allocation limits on your carrier services, with PRO allocating to the cheapest service that has not reached its limit. Continuing from the example above, PRO could combine the shipping rule and shipping mode effectively say \"From the pool of eligible carrier services (A,B, and D), A has reached its daily allocation limit, B would cost £10 to ship the goods, and D would cost £5 to ship the goods. Therefore, allocate the shipment to carrier service D. \" PRO shipping modes enable you to specify allocation limits with custom time ranges, which can be applied to both carrier services and shipping locations. Note For more information on configuring and using shipping modes, see the Managing Shipping Modes page of the UI user guide. <!-- ### Using Dangerous Goods Rules PRO version 2 enables you to manage which carrier services can carry which types of dangerous goods by setting up \"dangerous goods rulesets\" in the UI. This is a change from PRO version 1's consignments-based implementation, in which dangerous goods specifications are directly tied in to each carrier service. When setting up dangerous goods rules, you configure a ruleset independently of any carrier services and then link those rules to the services you require. This is especially useful if you have non-standard agreements with your carriers (that is, carriers will allow you to ship dangerous goods on a carrier service that would not normally take that class of goods). When allocating shipments, PRO takes your dangerous goods rulesets into account as part of its allocation rule checks. Any service that does not meet the rules is excluded. <!--<span class=\"commented-out\">INSTRUCTIONS FOR SETTING UP RULESETS IN HERE (WHEN IT'S IN THE UI)</span>--> Allocation Section Contents Allocating to Default Rules - Explains how to allocate shipments based on your pre-defined allocation rules.

PRO selects a service for you when you use these endpoints, rather than requiring you to select a service or service group manually. **Allocate Shipment** allocates a single shipment, while **Allocate Shipments** enables you to queue multiple shipments for allocation at once.--> Allocating a Single Shipment The Allocate Shipment endpoint allocates a single shipment to the most appropriate carrier service. To call Allocate Shipment , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate , where {reference} indicates the shipment that you want to allocate. Once the request has been received, PRO uses your shipping rules to determine which carrier services would be eligible to take the shipment, and your shipping modes to determine which of those services the shipment will be allocated to. The system then allocates the shipment and returns an Allocate Result object. Note For more information on the wider process PRO uses to allocate shipments, see the Selecting a Carrier Service section of the Allocating Shipments page. For more information on configuring and using shipping rules, see the Managing Shipping Rules page of the UI user guide. For more information on configuring and using shipping modes, see the Managing Shipping Modes page of the UI user guide. All PRO endpoints that allocate consignments individually return an Allocate Result object. The Allocate Result contains details of: The shipment's current state following the allocation request. For successful requests this would generally be Allocated . The carrier and service that the shipment was allocated to. The price of the allocation. Any relevant tracking references. The services that were unable to provide a quote. The shipping_date and expected_delivery_date for the shipment. Allocate Shipment Example The example shows a successful request to allocate a shipment with a {reference} of sp_01017652898121961272041674506240 via the Allocate Shipment endpoint.

PRO selects a service for you when you use these endpoints, rather than requiring you to select a service or service group manually. To call **Allocate Shipments**, send a `PUT` request to `https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocate`. The request body should contain an array of one or more shipment `{reference}`s to be allocated. Optionally, you can also include a list of service `capabilities`. If you provide a list of `capabilities`, then PRO only allocates the shipment to a carrier service that meets those capabilities. Each capability should list the `type` of service capability specified and the `value` that that capability should have. > [!NOTE] > For information on available service capabilities and values, see the [PRO v2 API reference](/pro/api/reference/shipments.html#tag/Allocation/paths/~1shipments~1allocate/put) Once the request is received, PRO takes each shipment in turn and attempts to queue it for allocation to the cheapest eligible carrier, as per the process detailed on the [Allocating Shipments](allocating_shipments.md#selecting-a-carrier-service) page. It then returns an Allocate Shipments result. [!include[_shipments_allocate_shipments_result](../includes/_shipments_allocate_shipments_result.md)] ### Allocate Shipments Example The example shows a request to queue three shipments for allocation.

This page explains PRO's allocation filters and how to use them. Making an Allocate with Filters Request The Allocate with Filters endpoint enables you to specify a list of shipments and a set of allocation criteria. When you make an Allocate with Filters request, PRO attempts to allocate all shipments in the list to a carrier service that meets the filters you specified. To call Allocate with Filters , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocation/filters . The body of the request should contain a shipments property listing the shipment {reference} s of the shipments you want to allocate, and a filters property defining the criteria you want to use to select a service. PRO accepts the following allocation filters: direction - The direction of the carrier services. Can be either inbound or outbound . pickup - A boolean value indicating whether to include pick-up services. drop-off - A boolean value indicating whether to include drop-off services. tags - A list of allocation tags to include, up to a maximum of 10. Any services that do not match all of the specified tags are excluded. Note For more information on allocation tags, see the Using Shipment Tags page. direction is mandatory, but all other properties are optional. The Allocate with Filters Response Once the request is received, PRO uses the filters provided to determine a list of available carrier services for the shipments to be allocated to. It then takes each shipment in the list and allocates it to a suitable service using the process defined in the Selecting a Carrier Service section of the Allocating Shipments page. <!-- Finally, PRO returns a <span class=\"commented-out\">SKIPPING THE REST OF THIS OF NOW AS THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN THE DATA CONTRACT - THE REQUEST FILTERS AVAILABLE CARRIER SERVICES BUT THE RESPONSE IMPLIES THAT IT'S THE SHIPMENTS FOR ALLOCATION BEING FILTERED</span> ## Allocate with Filters Example --> Next Steps Learn how to retrieve shipment data: Getting Shipments Learn how to manifest shipments: Manifesting Shipments Learn how to create shipment groups: Allocating Shipments"

This page explains how to allocate shipments to services manually. Getting the Carrier Service Reference In order to allocate a shipment to a specific carrier service, you'll need to know that service's {carrier_service_reference} . The {carrier_service_reference} is a unique identifier for each service available in PRO. Allocating A Single Shipment with a Specific Carrier Service The Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service endpoint enables you to allocate a shipment to a specific carrier service. To call Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate/service/{service_ref} , where {reference} refers to the shipment you want to allocate and {service_ref} is the reference of the carrier service that you want to allocate to. PRO then attempts to allocate the specified shipment to the specified carrier service and returns an Allocate Result. Note Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service does not override existing allocation rules. If the carrier service you selected does not meet your existing allocation rules, then PRO returns an error. All PRO endpoints that allocate consignments individually return an Allocate Result object. The Allocate Result contains details of: The shipment's current state following the allocation request. For successful requests this would generally be Allocated . The carrier and service that the shipment was allocated to. The price of the allocation. Any relevant tracking references. The services that were unable to provide a quote. The shipping_date and expected_delivery_date for the shipment. Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service Example The example shows a successful request to allocate shipment sp_00794355402411366010308868571136 to a carrier service with the {carrier_service_reference} FF_LINET-00001 .

Allocating Multiple Shipments with a Specific Carrier Service The Allocate With Carrier Service endpoint enables you to queue one or more shipments for allocation to a specific carrier service. To call Allocate With Carrier Service , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocate/service . The body of the request should contain a list of the {shipments} that you want to allocate and the {carrier_service_reference} of the carrier service you want to allocate to. Optionally, you can also include a list of service capabilities . Where capabilities are provided, then PRO only allocates the shipment to a carrier service that meets those capabilities. Each capability should list the type of service capability specified and the value that that capability should have. Note For information on available service capabilities and values, see the PRO v2 API reference . PRO queues the specified shipments for allocation to the specified service. It then returns an Allocate Shipments result detailing the results of the request. Note Where an Allocate with Carrier Service request is successful, PRO returns a 202 - Accepted response. Note that, as the Allocate with Carrier Service operation is asynchronous, this response only indicates that the specified shipments have been queued for allocation and does not guarantee that the shipments have been or will be successfully allocated. Allocate with Carrier Service does not override existing allocation rules. If the carrier service you selected does not meet your existing allocation rules, then PRO returns an error. All PRO endpoints that queue multiple shipments for allocation return an Allocate Shipments result. The Allocate Shipments result includes a list of all shipments that were successfully queued and details of all shipments that were rejected for allocation, including the references of those shipments and the reason for rejection. When you make a request to allocate multiple shipments simultaneously, PRO queues those shipments to be allocated at a later time rather than allocating them straight away. This helps to optimise performance. PRO then allocates queued shipments via an automated background process. Note If you only need to allocate a single shipment, you should use one of PRO's allocation endpoints for individual shipments ( Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service , Allocate Shipment with Service Group and Allocate Shipment with Virtual Service ) rather than a bulk allocation endpoint. Using an individual endpoint means that the shipment is allocated straight away. Allocate with Carrier Service Example The example shows a request to queue four shipments for allocation to a carrier service with the {carrier_service_reference} FF_LINET-00001. Three shipments have been successfully queued, but one was rejected because its {reference} could not be found.

This page explains how to <!--configure service groups, and how to--> use the Allocate Shipment with Service Group and Allocate with Service Group endpoints to allocate from within a specified shipping group. What Is a Carrier Service Group? SortedPRO carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used in conjunction with the Allocate Shipment with Service Group and Allocate with Service Group endpoints as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all shipments involving dangerous items. You can use any combination of carrier services in a carrier service group. Note Carrier service groups are configured through the UI. For information on managing your carrier service groups, see the Managing Carrier Service Groups section of the Sorted Admin Portal Guide. Allocating a Single Shipment with a Carrier Service Group The Allocate Shipment with Service Group endpoint allocates a shipment with a carrier service from a specific carrier service group. To call Allocate Shipment With Service Group , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate/service_group/{group_ref} , where {reference} is the unique reference for the shipment you want to allocate and {group_ref} is the Service Group Code of the group you want to allocate within. Note You can look up the Service Group Code of a particular group by logging in to the Sorted Admin Portal and selecting Settings > Carrier Service Groups . This UI page displays details of your available groups, including their Code . Once the request is received, PRO uses shipping rules to eliminate any carrier services in the group that would not be suitable to take the shipment, allocates the shipment to the cheapest remaining service, and returns an Allocate Result. Note For information on using shipping rules, see the What Is a Shipping Rule? section of the Allocating Shipments page. All PRO endpoints that allocate consignments individually return an Allocate Result object. The Allocate Result contains details of: The shipment's current state following the allocation request. For successful requests this would generally be Allocated . The carrier and service that the shipment was allocated to. The price of the allocation. Any relevant tracking references. The services that were unable to provide a quote. The shipping_date and expected_delivery_date for the shipment. Allocate Shipment with Service Group Example The example shows a successful request to allocate a shipment with a {reference} of sp_00794403010635468411384028069888 within a group that has a {group_ref} of valuableGoods .

To call Allocate with Service Group , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocate/service_group . The body of the request should contain a list of the {shipments} that you want to allocate and the {service_group} reference of the carrier service you want to allocate to.

PRO uses allocation rules to eliminate any carrier services in the group that would not be suitable to take the shipments, and the queues the shipments for allocation to the cheapest remaining service. It then returns an Allocate Shipments result detailing the results of the request. Note Where an Allocate with Service Group request is successful, PRO returns a 202 - Accepted response. Note that, as the Allocate with Service Group operation is asynchronous, this response only indicates that the specified shipments have been queued for allocation and does not guarantee that the shipments have been or will be successfully allocated. All PRO endpoints that queue multiple shipments for allocation return an Allocate Shipments result. The Allocate Shipments result includes a list of all shipments that were successfully queued and details of all shipments that were rejected for allocation, including the references of those shipments and the reason for rejection. When you make a request to allocate multiple shipments simultaneously, PRO queues those shipments to be allocated at a later time rather than allocating them straight away. This helps to optimise performance. PRO then allocates queued shipments via an automated background process. Note If you only need to allocate a single shipment, you should use one of PRO's allocation endpoints for individual shipments ( Allocate Shipment with Carrier Service , Allocate Shipment with Service Group and Allocate Shipment with Virtual Service ) rather than a bulk allocation endpoint. Using an individual endpoint means that the shipment is allocated straight away. Allocate with Service Group Example The example shows a request to queue four shipments for allocation within carrier service group exampleSG123 . Three shipments have been successfully queued, but one was rejected because its {reference} could not be found.

Tip The x-api-version header is explicitly required so that the API version used is always a conscious decision - i.e. you explicitly tell the API which specification version you wish to use. Sorted will frequently make enhancements and improvements to our platform, including after an API version is officially released. However, we will make all changes in a backwards-compatible way, without breaking or removing any existing API functionality. This makes it straightforward for you to continue to use our APIs without any risk of any API endpoints or data contracts changing without your knowledge. Backwards-Compatible Changes Sorted considers the following changes to be backwards-compatible. As such, your integration must be able to handle these types of changes: Adding new API resources (e.g. new API endpoints). Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints (e.g. query strings, route segments). Adding new properties to existing API responses. Adding new optional properties to existing API requests. Changing the order of properties in API responses. Changing the length or format of system-generated strings, such as object references or identifiers. This includes adding new prefixes to Sorted's standard reference format ( [a-z]_[0-9]{32} ). Adding new values to enumerations. This includes, for example, new API error codes and new shipment states, etc. Warning As a multi-tenant platform, Sorted must be able to make changes and introduce new functionality without providing advance notice to customers or seeking customer approval or sign-off. Your integration must be able to handle Sorted's industry-standard backwards-compatible changes. Example Changes This section gives examples of changes that Sorted consider to be backwards-compatible. Note These examples are not necessarily indicative of actual or planned changes and are used for purely illustrative purposes. New API Resource Sorted may add new API endpoints that do not clash with or override existing API endpoints. For example, the following API endpoint could be added and would not be considered a breaking change because its URL does not conflict with any existing API endpoint: https://api.sorted.com/pro/orders/{order-ref} New Optional Route Parameters Sorted may add new optional parameters to any existing API endpoint. For example, Sorted might choose to add a new type of document such as a VP44 . (This is not a real document. It is used for illustrative purposes only). The existing customs document endpoint could be updated to accept this new document as a route parameter: https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/{shipment-ref}/VP44 New Optional Query String Parameters Sorted might also add new optional query string parameters to existing API endpoints. This could be in addition to route parameters or instead of route parameters, as long as the existing URL continues to operate. For example, a new optional format={x} could be added to the label API endpoint to allow the label format to be specified using a query string as opposed to a route parameter: https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/{shipment-ref}?format=zpl New Resource Properties Whilst all existing properties will remain unchanged, Sorted may add new properties to API responses at any time. For example, Sorted might choose to add a new event_id property to error responses: { \"event\": { //<- new property \"id\": 10001, \"name\": \"Sample\" }, \"correlation_id\": \"6c4e6a77-feab-42ab-9d7b-f559dc1b90ca\", \"code\": \"validation_error\", \"message\": \"A provided property has an invalid format\", \"details\": [ { \"property\": \"addresses[0].contact.contact_details.email\", \"code\": \"invalid_format\", \"message\": \"'test@something' is not a valid email address\" } ], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.comerrors/400_invalid_format.html\", \"rel\": \"documentation\", \"reference\": \"invalid_format\" } ] } New Optional Request Properties Sometimes new properties might need to be added to API requests in order to accommodate new optional functionality. For example, new customs requirements may need to be introduced due to Brexit. As long as such properties are optional , this is not considered a breaking API change and is therefore backwards-compatible. For example, a new eori_number property could be added to a create_shipment_request . As long as this property is optional, this is considered a backwards-compatible change. New Enumeration Values Sorted may need to add new values to enumerations in line with business requirements. For example, the Document object contains a DocumentType enum listing valid document types. If Sorted were to add the (hypothetical) VP44 document given in an earlier example, then vp44 would be added to that enum."

Cancelling Shipments To cancel a shipment, use the Cancel Shipment endpoint. To call Cancel Shipment , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/cancel , where {reference} denotes the shipment you want to cancel. Once the request has been received, PRO changes the shipment's {state} to cancelled and returns a confirmation message. You can only cancel a shipment prior to that shipment being manifested. Once a shipment has been manifested it can no longer be cancelled. Once a shipment has been cancelled, then no further changes can be made to it. In order to reinstate a cancelled shipment you would need to create a new shipment with the same details. Note For full reference information on the Cancel Shipment endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

Using the Change Shipment State Endpoint Caution This endpoint is intended to enable you to change the state of a shipment due to exceptional circumstances, rather than as part of a standard workflow. PRO only allows certain manual state transitions. For instance, you cannot transition a shipment from a state of unallocated to allocated – this state change can only be carried out by the application itself as a result of a successful allocation. To call Change Shipment State , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/state . The body of the request should contain the unique reference of the shipment whose state you want to edit, the state that you want that shipment to be placed into, and a free text reason property detailing the reason for the change. The reason property does not affect the request itself, but instead forms part of the shipment's audit trail. PRO logs audit messages for all state transitions, including details of the change initiator. Once it has received a valid Change Shipment State request, PRO places the specified shipment into the requested state and returns a standard Resource Result object. Example Change Shipment State Call The example below shows a request to put shipment sp_00874350842266620068172088868864 into a state of ready_to_ship . PRO responds with a message confirming that the shipment was placed into the requested state.

This page is intended for users who are familiar with the Consignments model used in version 1, explaining what has changed and how the new system works. How Does On-Demand Shipping Work? PRO v1's Consignments model was based around high volume shipping from warehouses to end consumers. In this model, PRO could ship thousands of items for a customer daily, with carriers making regular scheduled collections from a small number of fulfilment centres before taking the goods to their own hubs and then shipping out to the end customer. In order to ship a consignment in a scheduled workflow, PRO requires a shipping location and a scheduled collection datetime. An example scheduled workflow is given below: PRO v2's Shipments model extends this functionality, giving you greater control over the collection part of the delivery cycle. PRO can now offer ad-hoc collections and deliveries from distributed stock locations, such as a ship-from-store model. On-demand shipping enables you to be more flexible in the way that goods are collected, and helps you to avoid the risk that warehousing from a single location can bring in a modern retail environment. PRO v2 gives you the ability to ship from thousands of locations all over the world. However, PRO hasn't lost any functionality. The PRO v2 API suite can also handle high volume traditional scheduled shipments just as well as v1. New Features As well as support for on-demand shipping, the enhancements to PRO's data contract have enabled us to add several additional new features to PRO. The PRO v2 API suite also includes: Shipment Groups and Collection Notes – A shipment group is a group of one or more shipments that can be operated on together. Grouping shipments fulfils several workflow needs, such as letting a driver use a collection note to sign off the shipments they've just collected from a store or manifesting shipments by trailer in a warehouse. Auto-Manifest - PRO can now automatically manifest shipments with carriers using a pre-configured schedule. REACT Powered Tracking - PRO now uses Sorted's REACT product as its core tracking engine, offering improved tracking functionality including push notifications and easy-to-configure tracking pages. Dangerous Goods – PRO's Dangerous Goods functionality has been completely overhauled, enabling you to use custom rulesets to configure which carrier services can carry which types of dangerous goods. This is especially useful if you have have non-standard agreements with carriers. Label Extension - PRO now offers improved support for label extensions, including the option to select whether you want standard or extended labels are part of your API call. Customs Documents - PRO's customs document generation engine has been overhauled to make it more efficient and scalable. Shipment Structure To facilitate these changes, the shipment has replaced the consignment as PRO's basic delivery unit in v2. Note Currently, PRO v1 customers will need to re-integrate in order to use the features introduced in PRO v2. To aid this process, we have designed the v2 API suite as an extension and enhancement to v1, keeping it as close as possible to the original structure. Like consignments, shipments are a collection of one or more packages that are shipped from the same origin address, to the same destination address, on behalf of the same Sorted customer, using the same carrier service, on the same day. However, the shipment object contains some new and reworked properties, including: shipment_type - Enables you to specify whether the shipment is intended to be allocated with an on-demand service or a scheduled service. This property affects PRO's validation when creating a shipment (as on_demand shipments have different mandatory properties to scheduled shipments) and the carrier services that the shipment can be allocated to. shipment_contents - The nested package and item objects used in consignments have been replaced by a list of contents objects. Each contents object represents an item within the shipment. For example, a shipment of a pair of shoes would contain one contents object defining the properties of the pair of shoes (e.g. dimensions, weight, etc.). contents.dangerous_goods - The new dangerous_goods object enables you to give significantly more detail on the nature of dangerous goods than the previous implementation, including physical form, radioactivity levels, accessibility during transit, and the class division of the goods according to the IATA standards. contents.label_property - Provides additional properties to be placed on the shipment's label. SortedPRO supports custom label decorators, which utilise additional label space to add fields and text. reservation - The reservation object enables PRO to store the details of reservations, such as booking details for click and collect options.

The Create Shipment Groups Request To call Create Shipment Group , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups . The body of the request should contain a list of up to 10,000 shipments that you want to add to the group, and an optional custom_reference that can be used as an identifier for the group. Shipment Group Validation All Create Shipment Group requests must conform to the following validation rules: You must provide between 1 and 10,000 references in the shipments list. All references must be for existing shipments that you have access to. All shipments must be in a state of either allocated or manifested . All shipments must have the same origin address or same origin shipping location reference. A shipment may only be a member of one open shipment_group at any one time. However, PRO still creates the group if you provide a reference for an invalid shipment, as long as there is at least once valid reference in the request. Shipment groups cannot share a custom_reference with another open shipment group. However, you can re-use previous custom_references as long as all previous groups that have used that reference are closed. custom_reference values must be URL-safe (that is, they cannot contain characters such as / , \\ , ? , @ unless encoded). The Create Shipment Group Response Once it has received and validated the request, PRO creates the shipment group and returns a Resource Result including the following information: reference . This is an auto-generated unique reference for the group. It is not to be confused with the custom_reference . custom_reference - The custom reference specified in the request. version - An integer indicating the number of times that the custom_reference has been used. errors - Indicates any shipments in the request that failed validation and could not be added to the group. Versioning Versioning enables you to identify any shipment group by custom_reference , even though custom_references can be re-used as long as they are not shared with any open groups. When you specify a custom_reference for a shipment group, PRO assigns that group a version number. Combined, the custom_reference and version provide a unique identifier for the group. A group's version number indicates how many times you have used that group's custom_reference . For example, suppose that you choose to use shipment groups to represent carrier trailers, so that you can manifest an entire trailer of shipments at once. To this end, you create a shipment group with a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM to represent Carrier X's daily afternoon collection. The first time you create this group, the group has a version number of 1 . You add the relevant shipments to the group, manifest them using the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint as they are picked up, and then close the shipment group. The following day, you create a new shipment group for that day's collection. As before, you use a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM . This time, however, PRO responds with a version number of 2 , as this is the second time that that custom_reference has been used. You can now use the version number to point to the shipment group you want. CarrierX-PM version 1 points to the original (now closed) shipment group, while CarrierX-PM version 2 points to the new group. Note that both groups also have unique (PRO-generated) references . Shipment group versioning is used when retrieving shipment groups, when adding or removing shipments from a group, and when generating collection notes. Note For more information on retrieving shipment groups, see the Getting Shipment Groups page. For more information on adding and removing shipments from a group, see the Editing Shipment Groups page. For more information on generating collection notes, see the Getting Collection Notes page. Examples Successful Request The example shows a successful request to create a shipment group. The group comprises three valid shipments and has a custom_reference of Example123 . Create Shipment Group Request Create Shipment Group Response { \"custom_reference\": \"Example123\", \"shipments\": [ \"sp_00013464648910021776641789788160\", \"sp_00013464648910021776641789784435\", \"sp_00013464648910021776641789790773\" ] } { \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"custom_reference\": \"Example123\", \"version\": 79, \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://beta.sorted.com/pro/shipments/groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"type\": \"shipment_group\" } ] } Note the version number of 79 in the response, indicating that the user has used the custom_reference Example123 78 times before. Invalid Shipment Reference Like the first example, this example response shows the successful creation of a shipment group. However, in this case not all of the shipments provided are valid, with one of the provided references in an invalid formant and another corresponding to a non-existent shipment. PRO has indicated the shipments that could not be added to the group in its response. Note In this case, the HTTP status code of the response would be 207 (Multi-status) . This code enables you to to differentiate between completely successful and partially successful group creation requests. Invalid Shipment Reference Response { \"errors\": [ { \"property\": \"shipments\", \"code\": \"invalid_reference_format\", \"message\": \"shp_000134646476641789784435 is not a valid shipment reference\" }, { \"property\": \"shipments\", \"code\": \"shipment_not_found\", \"message\": \"sp_00013464648910021776641789790773 could not be found\" } ], \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"custom_reference\": \"Example456\", \"version\": 59, \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 created successfully\", \"_links\": //omitted for brevity } Note For full reference information on the Create Shipment Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

This page explains how to use the Create Shipment endpoint to create a new shipment record <!--, how to clone existing shipments using the **Clone Shipment** endpoint, and how to update existing shipments using the **Update Shipment** endpoint--> . Sending a Create Shipment Request The Create Shipment endpoint enables you to create new shipment records within PRO. When you send a valid Create Shipment request, PRO generates a new shipment record and returns a unique {reference} for that shipment. Many of PRO's endpoints take this shipment {reference} as a parameter. To create a shipment, send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments . The body of the request should contain the shipment details, structured as per the PRO data contract. Required Shipment Properties As a minimum, the Create Shipments endpoint requires you to send: shipment_type - Specifies whether the shipment is on_demand (i.e. will require an ad-hoc carrier collection to be booked) or scheduled (i.e. will be picked up as part of a regularly scheduled carrier collection). contents - The contents of the shipment itself. addresses - All shipments require both origin and destination addresses. Tip PRO handles collection booking for on_demand shipments as a background process when the shipment is allocated to a carrier service. You do not need to specify on_demand booking details manually. Specifying Shipment Contents The contents object replaces the package and item objects used in PRO's version 1 consignments-based implementation. Contents objects are designed to nest within each other, and can be used at both package and item level. As an example, suppose that a clothing retailer has received a customer order for a necklace, a bracelet, and a coat. As the necklace and bracelet are both physically small, the retailer elects to ship them in the same package. The resulting shipment would contain: One contents object containing details of the coat and its accompanying package. One contents object containing details of the package that the necklace and bracelet are shipping in. One contents object containing details of the necklace, nested inside the object representing its package. One contents object containing details of the bracelet, nested inside the object representing its package. The example below shows how this shipment would be represented in JSON. This is a highly simplified example, with only the minimum properties given for each contents object. In practice, you would probably look to provide additional detail on the shipment contents by specifying optional properties. Contents Example \"contents\": [ { \"description\": \"Coat\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 30, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"contents\": null }, { \"description\": \"Package\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 40, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"contents\": [ { \"description\": \"Necklace\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 20, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"contents\": null }, { \"description\": \"Bracelet\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 20, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"contents\": null } ] } ] Specifying Addresses All shipments require both origin and destination addresses. In PRO, addresses are represented by address objects, which must be specified as a list inside the shipments.addresses property. As a minimum, each address must include the following: address_type - As well as origin and destination address types, PRO enables you to specify return , sender , recipient , importer , and billing addresses. shipping_location_reference - Each shipping location that you run scheduled shipments from should have a unique shipping location reference. The shipping_location_reference property is optional for on_demand shipments but required for scheduled shipments. Where provided, the value must be a valid shipping location reference for your organisation. Note PRO shipping locations are configured in the UI. For information on managing your shipping locations, see the Managing Shipping Locations page of the Sorted Admin Portal Guide. contact - Details of the contact at the address (for example, the name of the recipient). This property is only required where a shipping_location_reference is not provided. address_line_1 - All addresses must have at least one line. region - The state, county, or equivalent. This property is required for certain countries, such as the US, Australia, and Canada. postal_code - Required for countries with official postcode systems, such as the UK. country_iso_code - The ISO 3166 Alpha 2 code for the country. In addition, PRO supports several optional address properties, including custom references, company details, and latitude / longitude. See the PRO v2 API reference for details. Optional Shipment Properties There are lots of optional properties you can send when creating a shipment, including: Your own custom reference for the shipment. Required shipping and delivery dates. The order date. Customs documentation for international shipments. For more information on using customs documentation in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Shipment direction. Custom label properties. Tenant and channel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to use custom fields to record additional data about a shipment. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Using Shipment Tags page. Adding optional properties when you create a shipment can help you to ensure that your shipment is allocated to the most appropriate carrier service. Caution You should exercise caution when using the required_delivery_date and required_shipping_date parameters to specify dates for your shipment. These parameters limit delivery options for the shipment, meaning that it can only be allocated to those carrier services that would be able to ship it within the specified required_shipping_date range and / or deliver it by the specified required_delivery_date range. If the dates you specify are too restrictive, there may not be any carrier services available to take the shipment, which would result in a failed allocation. As such, you should only specify shipping and delivery dates where it is necessary to do so. Example Create Shipment Request The example below shows a simple Create Shipment request containing only a shipment_type , contents , and addresses . For an example of a full Create Shipment request, see the PRO v2 API reference . Create Shipment Request POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments { \"shipment_type\": \"on_demand\", \"contents\": [ { \"custom_reference\": \"b9fa91b0-0dd0-4dd5-986f-363fa8cb2386\", \"package_size_reference\": null, \"weight\": { \"value\": 2.40, \"unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"dimensions\": { \"unit\": \"Cm\", \"width\": 15.0, \"height\": 15.5, \"length\": 20.0 }, \"description\": \"Jeans\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 8.99, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"sku\": \"SKU09876\", \"model\": \"MOD-009\", \"country_of_origin\": \"PT\", \"harmonisation_code\": \"09021000\", \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"quantity\": 2, \"unit\": \"Box\", \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"Category\", \"value\": \"Menswear\", \"type\": \"string\" } ], \"label_properties\": null, \"Contents\": null } ], \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"Origin\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460864\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Mark\", \"last_name\": \"Brunell\", \"contact_details\": { \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"mark@62-7.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"1\", \"property_name\": \"Frank's Place\", \"address_line1\": \"Zappa Avenue\", \"address_line2\": \"Off Rock Road\", \"address_line3\": \"Off Heavy Crescent\", \"locality\": \"Manchester\", \"region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"postal_code\": \"M2 6LW\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"custom_reference\": \"21bbd58a-6dec-4097-9106-17501ddca38d\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460865\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Gardner\", \"last_name\": \"Minshew\", \"middle_name\": null, \"position\": null, \"contact_details\": { \"landline\": null, \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"gminshew@test.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"8\", \"property_name\": null, \"address_line1\": \"Norbert Road\", \"address_line2\": \"Bertwistle\", \"address_line3\": null, \"locality\": \"Preston\", \"region\": \"Lancashire\", \"postal_code\": \"PR4 5LE\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\", \"lat_long\": null } ] } The Create Shipments Response Once it has received the shipment information, PRO creates the shipment record and returns a link to the newly-created shipment, including its {reference} . The {reference} is a unique identifier for that shipment within PRO, and is a required parameter for many of PRO's API requests. Each PRO shipment {reference} takes the format sp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx , where x is a numerical digit. In the example below, PRO has returned a shipment {reference} of sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . Create Shipment Response { \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"message\": \"Shipment created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } All PRO shipments have a {state} , indicating the point in the delivery process that that particular shipment is at. Newly-created shipments have an initial state of Unallocated . For more information on PRO shipment states, see the Shipment States page. Note For full reference information on the Create Shipments endpoint, including the properties accepted and the structure required, see the PRO v2 API reference . <!--## Cloning Shipments <span class=\"commented-out\">CLONE SHIPMENTS IS IN DRAFT AT THE TIME OF WRITING - THIS ALL NEEDS FULLY REVIEWING BEFORE GO-LIVE</span> As well as creating entirely new shipments through the **Create Shipment** endpoint, you can also clone existing shipments via the **Clone Shipment** endpoint. **Clone Shipment** takes the basic properties of a given shipment, creates a new shipment with identical properties, and returns that new shipment's `{reference}`. > [!NOTE] > > **Clone Shipment** only clones those shipment properties that can be specified via the **Create Shipment** endpoint. For example, it will copy `address` and `contents` details to the new shipment, but not allocation details. To call **Clone Shipment**, send a `POST` request to `https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/clone`, where `{reference}` refers to the shipment you want to clone. Once it has received the request, PRO creates the new shipment record and returns a link to the newly-created shipment. ### Clone Shipment Example The example below shows a request to clone a shipment <span class=\"commented-out\">NEED TO PUT IN EXAMPLE ONCE THE ENDPOINT STUB IS UP AND RUNNING</span> > [!NOTE] > > For full reference information on the **Clone Shipment** endpoint, see the Shipments data contract --> Updating Shipments You can update an existing unallocated shipment via the Update Shipment endpoint. When you make an Update Shipment request, PRO overwrites the specified shipment's details with new details provided in the body of the request. To call Update Shipment , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments . You will need to specify the shipment reference in the body of the request, but the request should otherwise be structured in the same way as a Create Shipment request. The Update Shipment endpoint uses the same validation as Create Shipment (that is, shipment_type , contents , and addresses are required and all other valid properties are optional). When it has received the request, PRO replaces the entire shipment object for the specified shipment with the new details you provided, and returns a confirmation message. You cannot update a shipment that has already been allocated, because PRO uses a shipment's current details to decide the carrier services that that shipment can be allocated to. Caution If you do not pass a value for an optional property when making an Update Shipment request then PRO will not store any value for that property, even if that property had a value before you updated the shipment. You can only pass properties that would be accepted by a Create Shipment request when using Update Shipment . For example, you can update a shipment's contents and custom_reference , but not its allocation details or state . Update Shipment Example The example shows a simple Update Shipment request for a shipment with a {reference} of sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . The request is successful, meaning that PRO has any previous details for that shipment with the details in the request. Example Update Shipment Request Example Update Shipment Response PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments { \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"custom_reference\": \"MyCustomRef002\", \"shipment_type\": \"on_demand\", \"direction\": \"outbound\", \"contents\": [ { \"value\": { \"amount\": 2.99, \"currency\": \"GBP\" } } ], \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"origin\", \"shipping_location_reference\": \"myref\" }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"shipping_location_reference\": \"myref002\" } ] } { \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"custom_reference\": \"MyCustomRef002\", \"message\": \"Shipment sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 has been updated successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } Note For full reference information on the Update Shipment endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

It also explains how to lock shipment groups so that they can't be edited. Adding and Removing Shipments in Bulk The Update Shipment Group endpoint enables you to add and/or remove multiple shipments from a shipment group in a single API call. To call Update Shipment Group , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/ . The body of the request should contain: The unique reference of the shipment group you want to update ( not the user-defined custom_reference ). This must be an open and unlocked shipment group. An add_shipments property listing the unique references of the shipments you want to add to the group. These shipments must not be a member of either the specified shipment group or any other open shipment group. A remove_shipments property listing the unique references of the shipments you want to remove from the group. These shipments must be a member of the specified shipment group. Once it has received the request, PRO makes the requested additions and removals and returns a standard resource result object with links to the updated shipment group. Note Note that, while PRO validates the format of the provided shipment reference and confirms whether the shipment is allocated and part of an existing shipment group, it does not validate whether the shipment itself exists. As such, PRO will still return a 200 OK response if you provide a reference to a non-existing shipment, as long as that reference is in a valid format. For full reference information on the Update Shipment Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Update Shipment Group Example The example shows a request to add three shipments to and remove two shipments from shipment group sg_00682731282010871067439042134016 . Update Shipment Group Request Update Shipment Group Response https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/ { \"reference\": \"sg_00682731282010871067439042134016\", \"add_shipments\": [ \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134016\", \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134045\", \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134076\" ], \"remove_shipments\": [ \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134765\", \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134100\" ] } { \"reference\": \"sg_00682731282010871067439042134016\", \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00682731282010871067439042134016 updated successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://beta.sorted.com/pro/shipments/groups/sg_00682731282010871067439042134016\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"sg_00682731282010871067439042134016\", \"type\": \"shipment_group\" } ] } Adding Individual Shipments to a Shipment Group The Add Shipment to Group endpoints enable you to add individual shipments to an open and unlocked shipment group. You can select the group to add the shipment to in two ways: Using the group's unique {reference} - send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/shipments/{shipment_ref} . Using a combination of the group's {custom_ref} and {version} - send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/{custom_ref}/{version}/shipments/{shipment_ref} . The {version} parameter can be either an integer or the value latest . Note For an explanation of versioning in PRO shipment groups, see the Versioning in Shipment Groups section of the Getting Shipment Groups page. In both cases, {shipment_ref} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to add to the group. This shipment must not be a member of either the specified shipment group or any other open shipment group. Once it has received the request, PRO adds the specified shipment to the specified group and returns a standard resource result object with links to the shipment group that was updated. Note For full reference information on the Add Shipment to Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Add Shipment to Group Examples The examples show two requests to add shipment sp_00013473827456470532303387361290 to group sg_00013464648946915264789208891778 . In the first call, the group is identified by its unique {reference} , and in the second it is identified by its {custom_ref} and {version} . The response for both calls is the same.

You can specify the group that the shipment is to be removed from in two ways: Using the group's unique {reference} - send a DELETE request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/shipments/{shipment_ref} . This must be an open and unlocked shipment group. Using a combination of the group's {custom_ref} and {version} - send a DELETE request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/{custom_ref}/{version}/shipments/{shipment_ref} . The {version} parameter can be either an integer or the value latest . Note For more information on how versioning works in PRO shipment groups, see the Versioning in Shipment Groups section of the Getting Shipment Groups page. In both cases, {shipment_ref} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to remove from the group. This shipment must be a member of the specified shipment group. Once it has received the request, PRO removes the specified shipment from the specified group and returns a standard resource result object with links to the updated shipment group. Note For full reference information on the Remove Shipment from Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Remove Shipment from Group Examples The examples show two requests to remove shipment sp_00013473827456470532303387361290 from group sg_00013464648946915264789208891778 . In the first call, the group is identified by its unique {reference} , and in the second it is identified by its {custom_ref} and {version} . The response for both calls is the same.

You can only get collection notes for locked shipment groups. Note For more information on getting collection notes, see the Getting Collection Notes page. Locking Shipment Groups You can lock shipment groups using the Lock Shipment Group endpoint. To call Lock Shipment Group , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/lock , where {reference} is the unique reference of the group you want to lock. PRO locks the group and returns a standard resource result object with links to the shipment group that was updated. Note For full reference information on the Lock Shipment Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Unlocking Shipment Groups You can unlock shipment groups using the Unlock Shipment Group endpoint. To call Unlock Shipment Group , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/unlock , where {reference} is the unique reference of the group you want to unlock. PRO unlocks the group and returns a standard resource result object with links to the shipment group that was updated.

This page explains how to retrieve collection notes. Making a Collection Note Request In PRO, a collection note (sometimes referred to as a driver's manifest) is a document listing items that are to be collected by a driver. It is intended to be printed and given to the driver at the point of collection. In order to generate a note for a specific collection, you will need to tell PRO which shipments are to be picked up as part of that collection. You can do so using the Get Shipment Group Collection Note endpoint. <!-- PRO has three endpoints that enable you to do so: * **Get Shipment Group Collection Note** - Retrieves a collection note for all of the shipments in the specified shipment group. * **Get Collection Note by Query** - Retrieves a collection note for all of the shipments that meet the specified criteria. * **Get Collection Note by Manifests** - Retrieves a collection note for all of the shipments listed on the specified manifest files. --> Note This page explains how to generate a single collection note for a number of shipments that are being picked up together, for example as part of a scheduled collection. You can also get a collection note for a single shipment via the Get Document endpoint, which is covered on the Getting Shipment Documents page. Getting Collection Notes for a Shipment Group To call Get Shipment Group Collection Note , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/collection_notes/shipment_group/{reference} , where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment group you want to get a collection note for. Note PRO generates a collection note for a shipment group at the point that the group is locked. As such, you can only get collection notes for locked shipment groups. If you attempt to get a collection note for an unlocked shipment group then PRO returns a 404 - Not Found error. For more information on locking shipment groups, see the Locking and Unlocking Shipment Groups section of the Editing Shipment Groups page. Alternatively, you can call Get Shipment Group Collection Note using a shipment's {custom_reference} and {version} by sending a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/collection_notes/shipment_group/custom_reference/{custom_reference}/{version} . {version} must be either an integer or the value latest . PRO returns a collection note listing the contents of all of the shipments in the specified group. Note For an explanation of versioning in PRO shipment groups, see the Versioning in Shipment Groups section of the Getting Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Collection Notes API, see the PRO v2 API reference . All Collection Notes endpoints return a collection note as a document object with a document_type of collection_note . The document object has four properties: file - A base64-encoded byte array representing the file content. content_type - The document's format (e.g. application/pdf ). document_type - The type of document (e.g. commercial_invoice ). dpi - The document's resolution in DPI.

This page explains how to retrieve contents-level tracking events. Contents-Level Tracking Overview Contents-level tracking is useful for shipments with multiple items of contents that may ship at different times. PRO offers two endpoints that enable you to get contents-level tracking events: Get Contents-Level Tracking Events - Returns contents-level tracking events by unique shipment {reference} . Get Contents-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference - Returns contents-level tracking events by {custom_reference} . This endpoint may return tracking responses for more than one item of contents, because contents custom_references do not need to be unique. Getting Contents-Level Tracking Events To call the Get Contents-Level Tracking Events endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/{reference}/shipment_contents , where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to track. PRO returns a tracking_contents_response object for the shipment. The tracking_contents_response includes the following information: The shipment's unique reference and (where applicable) custom_reference . Details of the shipment's carrier. An updated expected delivery date for the shipment, where available. A list containing one contents_tracking_event object per item of shipment contents. Each contents_tracking_event represents a tracking response for an item of contents within the shipment. The contents_tracking_event object includes: The unique reference for the item of contents. Note The contents object's unique reference begins with sc and is located in the shipment's contents.reference property. It is not to be confused with the shipment's own reference , which begins with sp and is a unique identifier for the entire shipment. The custom_reference for the item of contents, where applicable. The carrier tracking reference for the item of contents. A list of standard PRO tracking_events for the item of contents. Note For more information on the structure of PRO tracking events, see the What Is a Tracking Event? section of the Tracking PRO Shipments page. For full reference information on the Get Contents-Level Tracking Events endpoint, see the Shipments data contract. Example Get Contents-Level Tracking Events Call The example shows a Get Contents-Level Tracking Events call for shipment sp_00076976827069691057723959934976 . In this case, the shipment has a single item of contents, which in turn has three tracking events available. Get Contents-Level Tracking Events Request Get Contents-Level Tracking Events Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/sp_00076976827069691057723959934976/shipment_contents { \"shipment_reference\": \"sp_00076976827069691057723959934976\", \"carrier\": { \"reference\": \"DNQ\", \"name\": \"DNQ Worldwide\", \"service_reference\": \"DNQWW72\", \"service_name\": \"DNQ Worldwide 72-Hour Express\" }, \"shipment_contents\": [ { \"carrier_references\": [ \"5805984057422232\" ], \"reference\": \"sc_00076982052497331561502355750928\", \"events\": [ { \"reference\": \"tr_00076982052571118537797193957408\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-07-23T17:42:00+01:00\", \"received_timestamp\": \"2019-07-23T16:45:44+00:00\", \"event_code\": \"delivered\", \"description\": \"The parcel was handed to the resident\", \"signee\": \"P.

The items of contents in question must be tagged with the relevant references via the {custom_reference} property. The endpoint can also be used where a consumer order corresponds to multiple items of contents. In order to use the Get Contents-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference endpoint in this way, all of the order's component contents would need to be tagged with the same {custom_reference} . To call Get Contents-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/{custom_reference}/shipment_contents . Note The {custom_reference} parameter in the Get Contents-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference path refers to the custom_reference of the item of shipment contents and NOT the custom_reference of the shipment itself. For example, suppose that you have a shipment with a custom_reference of 1234 , which contains three items of contents that all have the custom_reference ABCD . To view tracking details for those items of contents via the Get Contents-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference endpoint, you would call https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/ABCD/shipment_contents rather than https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/1234/shipment_contents Response Structure PRO returns a tracking_contents_response_list object containing tracking information for any items of shipment contents that have the specified {custom_reference} . The tracking_contents_response_list comprises a list of tracking_contents_responses , as well as fields indicating the total number of matching records and (where applicable) the number of records that were taken or skipped using paging parameters. Each tracking_contents_response represents tracking details for a shipment that has contents that have the supplied {custom_reference} . The tracking_contents_response includes the following information: The shipment's unique {reference} and (where applicable) {custom_reference} . Details of the carrier and carrier service for the shipment. An updated expected delivery date for the shipment, where available. A list of contents_tracking_event objects. Each contents_tracking_event object represents tracking details of an item of shipment contents. The contents_tracking_event object includes the following information: The item's unique {reference} and (where applicable) {custom_reference} . Note The contents object's unique reference begins with sc and is located in the shipment's contents.reference property. It is not to be confused with the shipment's own reference , which begins with sp and is a unique identifier for the entire shipment. The carrier tracking references for the item A list of standard PRO tracking_events for the item of contents. Note For more information on the structure of PRO shipment tracking events, see the What Is a Tracking Event? section of the Tracking PRO Shipments page. Paging Results The Get Contents-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference endpoint supports optional {take} and {skip} parameters, which can be used to drive paging functions. The {take} parameter indicates the number of shipments to return (up to a maximum of 10), and the {skip} parameter indicates the number of shipment records PRO should \"skip over\" before it returns records. For example, suppose that you have 15 shipments with a custom_reference of CR1234 , and you want to return their tracking information as three pages of five shipments: To view the first page of five, you would make a call to GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/CR1234/shipment_contents&take=5&skip=0 (that is, take five shipments and do not skip over any). To view the second page, you would call GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/CR1234/shipment_contents&take=5&skip=5 (skip the first five shipments and then take the next five). To view the third page, you would call GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/CR1234/shipment_contents&take=5&skip=10 (skip the first ten shipments and then take the next five). By default, {take} has a value of 10 and {skip} has a value of 0.

This page explains the various way in which SortedPRO can return this documentation. Documentation in PRO Once a shipment is allocated, PRO automatically determines what documentation is required for it. PRO can generate the following document types: cn22 - Customs documentation. Only generated for applicable international shipments. cn23 - Customs documentation. Only generated for applicable international shipments. commercial_invoice - Customs documentation. Only generated for applicable international shipments. hazard_label - Generated for shipments containing dangerous goods. collection_note - A driver's manifest for the shipment. Generated for all shipments. Note PRO also generates delivery labels, which have the same data structure as shipment documents and are also created after allocation. However, labels are managed through their own dedicated endpoints, and cannot be returned through PRO's Documents endpoints. For information on using delivery labels in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Labels page. PRO offers two endpoints to retrieve documents once they have been generated: Get Document retrieves a specific document. Get Customs Documents retrieves all customs documents (that is, CN22, CN23, and commercial invoice documents) that have been generated for a particular shipment. Note PRO's auto-generated documents should not be confused with paperless documents. Paperless documents are documents that are attached to a shipment prior to allocation and transmitted to a carrier as part of that shipment's data. Auto-generated documents are created by PRO at the point of allocation and are intended to be printed before the carrier picks the shipment up. For more information on using paperless documents in PRO, see the Adding Paperless Documents page. Getting a Specific Shipment Document To call Get Document , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/{shipment_reference}/{document_type} , where {shipment_reference} is the unique reference of the shipment that the document belongs to and {document_type} is the type of document you want to return for that shipment. If the specified shipment has a document of the specified type, then PRO returns a document object representing that document. Otherwise, PRO returns an error. Note If you use the Get Document endpoint to get a collection_note for a shipment, then PRO returns a collection note for the contents of that shipment only. If you need collection notes for multiple shipments being picked up by the same carrier (as part of a scheduled collection, for example), you should use one of PRO's dedicated Collection Notes endpoints instead. For more information on using collection notes in PRO, see the Getting Collection Notes page. For full reference information on the Get Document endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Getting All of a Shipment's Customs Documents To call Get Customs Documents , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/{shipment_reference} , where {shipment_reference} is the unique reference of the shipment that you want to get customs documents for. If the specified shipment has customs documents (that is, it is an international shipment), then PRO returns a list of document objects representing those documents. Otherwise, PRO returns an error. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Documents endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . The Document Response Both Documents endpoints return document objects. Get Document returns a single document , while Get Customs Documents returns a list. The document object has four properties: file - A base64-encoded byte array representing the file content. content_type - The document's format (e.g. application/pdf ). document_type - The type of document (e.g. commercial_invoice ). dpi - The document's resolution in DPI. Note As customs documents are generated at the point of allocation, PRO returns a 404 - Not Found error if you attempt to get documents for an unallocated shipment. This code signifies that the request passed validation but there are no documents available for the specified shipment. Examples The example below shows a successful Get Document request for the cn22 document associated with shipment sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 . PRO returns a document object representing that document. In this example, the Base64 data returned has been removed for clarity.

For more information on using REACT, see the REACT section. <!-- ## Shipment-Level Tracking Overview In shipment-level tracking, PRO returns tracking events for the entire shipment, without making a distinction between individual items of contents within that shipment. PRO offers two endpoints that enable you to get shipment-level tracking events: * **Get Tracking Events** - Returns shipment-level tracking events by unique shipment `{reference}`. * **Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference** - Returns shipment-level tracking events by `{custom_reference}`. --> Getting Tracking Events by Shipment Reference PRO's Get Tracking Events endpoint is intended to drive simple web-based tracking pages. When the API is called, PRO returns a response listing the tracking events that have occurred since that shipment was dispatched. To call the Get Tracking Events endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/{reference} , where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to track. PRO returns a tracking_response object for the shipment. The tracking_response includes the following information: The shipment's unique reference and (where applicable) custom_reference . Details of the carrier and carrier service for the shipment. An updated expected delivery date for the shipment, where available. A list of tracking events for the shipment. Each tracking event is an informational message returned from the carrier, providing details about the status of the shipment. It contains the following properties: reference - A unique identifier for the tracking event. timestamp - The time and date that the tracking event occurred. received_timestamp - The time and date that the tracking event was received by Sorted. event_code - A unique identifier for the type of tracking event (for example delivered ). description - A description of the tracking event. signee - The name of the person who signed for the package, if applicable. location - The location of the tracking event, if applicable. lat_long The latitude and longitude of the location at which the event took place, where provided. Note For full reference information on the Get Tracking Events endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

Your shipments must be tagged with the relevant references via the `{custom_reference}` property. The endpoint can also be used where a consumer order corresponds to multiple shipments, for example because the order contains items that will need to ship from different fulfilment centres. In order to use the **Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference** endpoint in this way, all of the order's component shipments would need to be tagged with the same `{custom_reference}`. To call the **Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference** endpoint, send a `GET` request to `https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/{custom_reference}`. PRO returns a `tracking_response_list` object containing tracking information for any shipments that have the specified `{custom_reference}`. The `tracking_response_list` comprises a list of `tracking_responses`, as well as fields indicating the total number of matching shipments and (where applicable) the number of records that were taken or skipped using paging parameters. Each `tracking_response` includes the following information: * The shipment's unique `{reference}` and (where applicable) `{custom_reference}`. * Details of the carrier and carrier service for the shipment. * An updated expected delivery date for the shipment, where available. * A list of tracking events for the shipment. > [!NOTE] > * For more information on the structure of PRO shipment tracking events, see the [What Is a Tracking Event?](tracking_pro_shipments.md#what-is-a-tracking-event) section of the [Tracking PRO Shipments](tracking_pro_shipments.md) page. ### Paging Results The **Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference** endpoint supports optional `{take}` and `{skip}` parameters, which can be used to drive paging functions. The `{take}` parameter indicates the number of shipments to return (up to a maximum of 10), and the `{skip}` parameter indicates the number of shipment records PRO should \"skip over\" before it returns records. For example, suppose that you have 15 shipments with a `custom_reference` of _CR1234_, and you want to return their tracking information as three pages of five shipments: * To view the first page of five, you would make a call to `GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/CR1234&take=5&skip=0` (that is, take five shipments and do not skip over any). * To view the second page, you would call `GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/CR1234&take=5&skip=5` (skip the first five shipments and then take the next five). * To view the third page, you would call `GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/tracking/custom_reference/CR1234&take=5&skip=10` (skip the first ten shipments and then take the next five). By default, `{take}` has a value of 10 and `{skip}` has a value of 0. > [!NOTE] > * For full reference information on the **Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference** endpoint, see the Shipments data contract. ### Example Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference Call The example shows a **Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference** call for all shipments with the `{custom_reference}` _CR1234_, using default paging settings.

Overview of Retrieving Shipment Groups PRO has three endpoints that enable you to retrieve details of existing shipment groups: Get Shipment Group retrieves a single shipment group by its unique reference . Get Shipment Groups by Custom Reference retrieves a summary of any shipment groups that have the specified custom_reference . Get Shipment Group by Custom Reference retrieves a single shipment group using a combination of custom_reference and version . Shipment Group References In PRO, shipment groups can be retrieved by two types of reference: reference is a unique identifier generated for every shipment group you create. It begins with sg . custom_reference is a user-defined optional reference that is supplied as part of a Create Shipment Group call. While two open groups cannot share the same custom_reference , the custom_reference of a previously-closed group can be re-used. Because the custom_reference can be re-used, it is not a unique identifier for a group. To this end, PRO uses versioning as a means of uniquely identifying groups by custom_reference . Versioning in Shipment Groups When you specify a custom_reference for a shipment group, PRO assigns that group a version number. Combined, the custom_reference and version provide a unique identifier for the group. A group's version number indicates how many times you have used that group's custom_reference . For example, suppose that you choose to use shipment groups to represent carrier trailers, so that you can manifest an entire trailer of shipments at once. To this end, you create a shipment group with a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM to represent Carrier X's daily afternoon collection. The first time you create this group, the group has a version number of 1 . You add the relevant shipments to the group, manifest them using the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint as they are picked up, and then close the shipment group. The following day, you create a new shipment group for that day's collection. As before, you use a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM . This time, however, PRO responds with a version number of 2 , as this is the second time that that custom_reference has been used. You can now use the version number to point to the shipment group you want. CarrierX-PM version 1 points to the original (now closed) shipment group, while CarrierX-PM version 2 points to the new group. Note that both groups also have unique (PRO-generated) references . Getting Shipment Groups by Group Reference To call Get Shipment Group , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference} , where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment group you want to retrieve details for. PRO returns a shipment_group object. The shipment_group object contains the following information: The group's unique reference . The group's custom_reference and version (if applicable). A list of the shipments in the group. The current state of the group. The date that the group was created . The dates that the group was locked , closed , and/or updated (if applicable). Get Shipment Group Example The example shows a request for shipment sg_00013464648946915264789208891778 . Get Shipment Group Request Get Shipment Group Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/sg_00013464648946915264789208891778 { \"reference\": \"sg_00013464648946915264789208891778\", \"shipments\": [ \"sp_00013473827456470532303387361290\", \"sp_09830498509898987009909000543435\" ], \"custom_reference\": \"CarrierX-PM\", \"version\": \"1\", \"state\": \"open\", \"created\": \"2019-05-03T17:00:23+01:00\" } Note For full reference information on the Get Shipment Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Getting Shipment Groups by Custom Reference To call Get Shipment Groups by Custom Reference , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/{custom_reference} . PRO returns details of every shipment group that has the specified custom_reference , irrespective of version . Specifically, PRO returns a list of shipment_group_summary objects. Each shipment_group_summary is a simplified version of the full shipment_group object, containing the following information: The group's unique reference . The group's custom_reference and version (if applicable). Links to the full version of the group. Example Get Shipment Groups by Custom Reference Call The example shows a request for a summary of all shipment groups with the custom_reference CarrierX-PM . PRO has returned a summary of two shipment groups. Get Shipment Groups by Custom Reference Request Get Shipment Groups by Custom Reference Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/CarrierX-PM [ { \"reference\": \"sg_00013464648946915264789208891778\", \"custom_reference\": \"CarrierX-PM\", \"version\": 1, \"_links\": [ { \"rel\": \"self\", \"href\": \"/pro/shipment_groups/sg_00013464648946915264789208891778\" }, { \"rel\": \"version\", \"href\": \"/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/CarrierX-PM/1\" } ] }, { \"reference\": \"sg_00013464648946915264789208891788\", \"custom_reference\": \"CarrierX-PM\", \"version\": 2, \"_links\": [ { \"rel\": \"self\", \"href\": \"/pro/shipment_groups/sg_00013464648946915264789208891788\" }, { \"rel\": \"version\", \"href\": \"/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/CarrierX-PM/2\" } ] } ] Getting a Shipment Group by Custom Reference and Version To call Get Shipment Group by Custom Reference , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/custom_reference/{custom_reference}/{version} , where {custom_reference} is the reference you want to search on and {version} represents the group version you want PRO to return. {version} can be either an integer or the value latest . PRO returns a full shipment group object (as opposed to the summaries returned by the Get Shipment Groups by Custom Reference endpoint). The shipment group object contains the following information: The group's unique reference . The group's custom_reference and version (if applicable). A list of the shipments in the group. The current state of the group. The date that the group was created . The dates that the group was locked , closed , and/or updated (if applicable). Example Get Shipment Group by Custom Reference Call These examples show two calls, based on the data used in previous examples on this page: one to get a group with a custom_reference of CarrierX-PM and a version of 1 , and one to get the latest CarrierX-PM group.

This page explains how to get labels for a specific shipment or an individual package within a shipment. The Labels Request Getting labels is a key part of all PRO workflows, as an unlabelled shipment cannot be despatched. When a shipment is allocated, PRO generates delivery labels for all of that shipment's contents properties. Labels are usually retrieved before a shipment has been manifested. PRO offers label extensions, which enable customers to specify custom text, images and QR codes on their labels. Each PRO customer can have a single label extension, which is configured during the onboarding process. Caution You can only retrieve labels for shipments that have been allocated to a carrier. If you attempt to return labels for an unallocated shipment, PRO returns an error. Getting All Labels for a Shipment The Get Labels endpoint retrieves all labels for the specified shipment. To call Get Labels , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/{shipment_reference}/{format}(/dpi) , where {shipment_reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to get labels for, {format} is the file format required (either PDF or ZPL), and {dpi} indicates the resolution required. Get Labels also has an optional ?include_extension=bool boolean (true/false) parameter enabling you to specify whether you want the returned labels to include your custom label extensions. If you do not provide an include_extension query then PRO returns label extensions by default. Note For full reference information on the Get Labels endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference Example Get Labels Calls GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/sp_00668400124857422605561635799040/zpl/300 - Get all labels for shipment sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 in ZPL format at 300 DPI resolution. GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/sp_00668400124857422605561635799040/pdf/300?include_extension=false - Get all labels for shipment sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 in PDF format at 300 DPI resolution, without label extensions. Getting a Label for a Specific Item of Contents The Get Contents Label endpoint retrieves the label for a specific item of shipment contents. To call Get Contents Label , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/{shipment_reference}/contents/{contents_reference}/{format}/{dpi} , where {shipment_reference} is the unique reference of the shipment that the contents belong to, {contents_reference} is the unique reference of the contents object you want to get the label for, {format} is the file format required (either PDF or ZPL), and {dpi} indicates the resolution required. Note The contents object's unique reference begins with sc and is located in the shipment's contents.reference property. It is not to be confused with the shipment's own reference , which begins with sp and is a unique identifier for the entire shipment. Get Contents Label also has an optional ?include_extension=bool boolean (true/false) parameter enabling you to specify whether you want the returned labels to include your custom label extensions. If you do not provide an include_extension query then PRO returns label extensions by default. Note For full reference information on the Get Contents Label endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference Example Get Contents Label Calls GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/sp_00668400124857422605561635799040/contents/sc_00668412927930827428118192193538/zpl/300 - Get all labels for contents sc_00668412927930827428118192193538 (located within shipment sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 ) in ZPL format at 300 DPI resolution.

The Labels Response Both Labels API endpoints return document objects. The document object has four properties: file - A base64-encoded byte array representing the file content. content_type - The document's format (e.g. application/pdf ). document_type - The type of document (e.g. commercial_invoice ). dpi - The document's resolution in DPI. Labels always have a document_type of label . Note PRO's Get Documents endpoint also retrieves documents. However, it cannot return documents with a document_type of label . PRO returns an error if you attempt to retrieve a label through Get Documents . Get Labels and Get Contents Label are the only PRO endpoints that can return labels. Example Label Response The example shows a sample label response in ZPL format. Example Label { \"file\": (Base64 file data), \"content_type\": \"text/plain\", \"document_type\": \"label\", \"dpi\": 203 } Using the Label Data Once you have downloaded the file data, you will need to decode the file's Base64 in order to view the label itself. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Next Steps Learn how to add shipments to a carrier manifest at the Manifesting Shipments page.

The Get Quote endpoint returns quotes based on the details of an existing shipment. Specifically, it takes a shipment reference and uses that shipment's details to return a list of quote s. To call Get Quote , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/quote , where reference is the unique identifier of the shipment you want to get quotes for. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes a summary of the shipment details submitted, a list of quote objects, and a list of excluded_services (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Each quote object contains the following information: A unique reference for the quote. Confirmation of the shipment reference that you requested quotes for. Creation and expiry dates. Details of the relevant carrier and carrier service. Confirmation of collection and delivery dates. Pricing information. At this point, you would be able to display the relevant quote information to your customer service operative. Note The quote reference begins with qu and can be found in the quotes.reference property of the Quote Result. It is not to be confused with the Quote Result's own reference , which begins with qc and is a unique reference for the entire quote response rather than a selectable quote.

Getting Shipments by Shipment Reference The Get Shipment endpoint takes the {reference} of the shipment you want to view and returns details of that shipment. To call Get Shipment , send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference} , where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to retrieve. The information returned is structured in a broadly similar way to a Create Shipment request, but also contains additional properties (that is, properties that are managed by PRO rather than explicitly stated by the customer when a shipment is created). These properties include: reference - The shipment's unique reference. state - The shipment's current state . For a full list of shipment states, see the Shipment States page. created - The date and time that the shipment was created. updated - The date and time that the shipment was last updated, where applicable. shipping_date - The assigned shipping date for the shipment based on the active allocation, where applicable. expected_delivery_date - The expected date(s) for delivery based on the current active allocation, where applicable. actual_delivery_date - The actual date and time that the shipment was delivered, where applicable. allocation - Details of the active allocated carrier and service for the shipment, where applicable. label_details - Links to retrieve labels for allocated shipments, and fields indicating whether labels have already been retrieved. reservation - Details of any reservation for the shipment (for example, click and collect options), where applicable. _links - Links to any related resources. Note For full reference information on the Get Shipment endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

endpoint enables you to search for shipment data by either your own custom reference number or the tracking number assigned to the shipment by the carrier. Searching by Custom Reference In PRO, a custom_reference is a user-specified reference for a shipment or item of shipment contents. Custom references do not need to be unique. For example, you might use the custom_reference property to add your own order number to all shipments corresponding to a particular order. To search for shipments by custom reference, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments?custom_reference={reference} , where {reference} is the custom_reference you want to search on. Note The custom_reference property can be applied to both shipments and shipment_contents objects. The Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference endpoint returns both those shipments that are directly tagged with the specified custom_reference and those shipments that contain a shipment_contents object with the specified custom_reference . For more information on the structure of shipment contents, see the Specifying Shipment Contents section of the Creating Shipments page. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a shipment_list object containing a list of shipments, the total number of results, the number of shipments requested and the number of shipments skipped. Searching by Carrier Tracking Reference To use Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference to search by tracking reference, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments?carrier_tracking_reference={tracking_reference} , where {tracking_reference} is the carrier tracking reference you want to search on. Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference can only return allocated shipments, as carrier tracking references are assigned to shipments at the point of allocation. The carrier tracking_reference can be found in the shipment's allocation.tracking_references property. It can also be found in the tracking_details.shipment.tracking_references property of the Allocation Summary object that is returned when a shipment is allocated. Note As carrier tracking references can repeat, the Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference endpoint only returns shipments that have been allocated within the last 30 days. Any older shipments may still be present in the database, but are not returned by the endpoint. Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference only works with those tracking references provided by carriers. It does not return shipments for internally-generated PRO or REACT references. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a shipment_list object containing a list of shipments, the total number of results, the number of shipments requested and the number of shipments skipped. Example Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference Call The example shows a successful request to get all shipments that either have the custom_reference or contain contents with the custom_reference CR1234 . In this case, PRO has returned one shipment. Get Shipments by Custom Reference Request Get Shipments by Custom Reference Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments?custom_reference=CR1234 { \"shipment_details\": [ { \"reference\": \"sp_01028948599727063714816940703744\", \"custom_reference\": \"CR1234\", \"created\": \"2021-03-03T14:16:55.3604051+00:00\", \"weight\": { \"value\": 4.900, \"unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"value\": { \"amount\": 17.98, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"shipping_date\": { \"has_value\": false }, \"required_delivery_date\": { \"has_value\": false }, \"expected_delivery_date\": { \"has_value\": false }, \"required_shipping_date\": { \"has_value\": false }, \"state\": \"unallocated\", \"destination_address\": { \"address_type\": \"Destination\", \"custom_reference\": \"21bbd58a-6dec-4097-9106-17501ddca38d\", \"company_name\": \"Company2\", \"property_number\": \"8\", \"property_name\": \"Queen\", \"address_line1\": \"Norbert Road\", \"address_line2\": \"Bertwistle\", \"address_line3\": \"Near Nothing\", \"locality\": \"Preston\", \"region\": \"Lancashire\", \"postal_code\": \"PR4 5LE\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" }, \"shipment_type\": \"on_demand\" } ], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api-int.sorted.com/pro/shipment_details/?reference=&custom_reference=CR1234&carrier_tracking_reference=&postal_code=&category=&state=&start=&end=&take=100&skip=0\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"type\": \"shipment_details\" } ], \"total_results\": 1, \"take\": 10, \"skip\": 0 } Note For full reference information on the Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Paging Results The Get Shipments by Custom Reference or Tracking Reference endpoint supports optional {take} and {skip} parameters, which can be used to drive paging functions. The {take} parameter indicates the number of shipments to return (up to a maximum of 10), and the {skip} parameter indicates the number of shipment records PRO should \"skip over\" before it returns records. For example, suppose that you have 15 shipments with a custom_reference of CR1234 , and you want to return them as three pages of five shipments: To view the first page of five, you would make a call to GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments?custom_reference=CR1234&take=5&skip=0 (that is, take five shipments and do not skip over any). To view the second page, you would call GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments?custom_reference=CR1234&take=5&skip=5 (skip the first five shipments and then take the next five). To view the third page, you would call GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments?custom_reference=CR1234&take=5&skip=10 (skip the first ten shipments and then take the next five). By default, {take} has a value of 10 and {skip} has a value of 0.

This guide explains some common integration designs for PRO's APIs, helping you to see what PRO can do for your business. We'll cover: Creating and manifesting a shipment The Allocate and Manifest design is a simple call flow to create a shipment, allocate it to a scheduled or ad-hoc carrier service using criteria of your choosing, retrieve delivery labels, and manifest it with the carrier. This design would be best used to facilitate bulk shipments from a warehouse or enable a ship-from-store model. Managing shipments in bulk with Shipment Groups The Shipment Groups design uses PRO's Shipment Groups feature to manage a collection of shipments as a single group. This design enables you to align PRO to your warehouse operations closely, for example by manifesting and getting collection notes for all of the shipments that are due to be loaded on to a particular vehicle at once. Note This guide is intended as a primer for PRO. If you're already familiar with the basics of PRO, or you just need reference info for PRO's APIs, see the API Reference . All of the URLs and examples given in this documentation relate to PRO's live production environment. To call APIs in the sandbox environment, substitute the api.sorted.com/pro portion of the API's base URL with api.sorted.com/pro-sandbox . Don't forget to use your sandbox API key (as opposed to your production API key) when making the call. For more information on PRO's sandbox, see Using the Sandbox Environment ."

A common use case for shipment groups is to match operational flows, such as adding multiple shipments to a cage or trailer to be taken in a batch by a carrier. Similar to the Shipment Groups design, Quote with Shipment Groups contains an additional step in which you can check whether a shipment can be allocated to a carrier service by making a quote request at the start of the process. Making a quote request in this way can help you to identify shipments that cannot be allocated (for example, because their required_delivery_date and required_shipping_date parameters might be too restrictive) before those shipments are created. Note This page provides help and support for PRO version 2 (Shipments). As PRO v2 is currently in development, content may be updated as and when necessary. For support on PRO v1 (Consignments), click here . There are thirteen steps to the design: Get a quote - Use the Quote Shipment or Quote Shipment by Service Group endpoints to perform a quote request using the shipment details. Create the shipment - Use the Create Shipment endpoint to record the details of your new shipments. (Optional) Add paperless documents - Use the Add Paperless Document endpoint to add documents to shipment data. Allocate the shipment - Use the Allocate Shipments with Service Group endpoint to allocate within a pre-defined list of carrier services. Get the shipment's labels - Use the Get Labels endpoint to get delivery label for the shipment. (Optional) Get customs documents for the shipment - Use the Get Customs Documents to generate printable customs documents for international shipments. Create the shipment group - Use the Create Shipment Group endpoint to create the shipment group and add your shipments to it. (Optional) Update the szhipment group - Use the Update Shipment Group endpoint to add or remove shipments from your shipment group. Lock the shipment group - Use the Lock Shipment Group endpoint to prevent further changes from being made to the group. (Optional) Unlock the shipment group - Use the Unlock Shipment Group endpoint to release the lock, allowing further changes to be made to the group. (Optional) Get a collection note for the shipment group - Use the Get Collection Note by Shipment Group endpoint to generate a driver's manifest containing all shipments in the group. Manifest the shipment group - Use the Manifest Shipment Group endpoint to send shipment data to the selected carrier. Close the shipment group - Use the Close Shipment Group endpoint to close the group, finalising all changes. This section gives more detail on each step of the design and provides worked examples. Step 1: Get a Quote Create Quote Create Quote Endpoint GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/quote To retrieve quotes for an as-yet-uncreated shipment, use the Create Quote endpoint. Retrieving quotes prior to creating a shipment enables you to confirm that the shipment is \"shippable\" (i.e. that there are carriers who can deliver the shipment within the dates specified) as well as giving an indication of delivery costs. Once it has received the Create Quote request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes a summary of the shipment details submitted, a list of quote objects, and a list of excluded_services (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Note For full reference information on the Create Quote endpoint, see the Create Quote page of the API reference. For a user guide on working with quotes in PRO, see the Managing Shipment Quotes page of the API User Guide. Create Quote Example The example below shows a quote request for a shipment.

Tip In PRO, carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all shipments involving dangerous items. Once it has received the Create Quote by Service Group request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes a summary of the shipment details submitted, a list of quote objects, and a list of excluded_services (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Note For full reference information on the Create Quote by Service Group endpoint, see the Create Quote by Service Group page of the API reference.

Shipments are created using the Create Shipment endpoint, which takes information about new shipments, adds them to the database, and returns a link to the newly-created shipment, including its {reference} . A newly created shipment has a {state} of unallocated . As a minimum, the Create Shipments endpoint requires you to send details of the contents of the shipment and its origin and destination addresses. You must also specify whether the shipment is on_demand (i.e. will require an ad-hoc carrier collection to be booked) or scheduled (i.e. will be picked up as part of a regularly scheduled carrier collection). Note For full reference information on the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Create Shipment page of the API reference. For a user guide explaining the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Creating Shipments page. Create Shipments Example This example shows the creation of a fairly standard shipment. In this case, we have an outbound shipment comprising a single package. After receiving the request, PRO returns a shipment {reference} of sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . Many of PRO's functions require you to provide this shipment {reference} as a parameter. Create Shipment Request Create Shipment Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments { \"shipment_type\": \"on_demand\", \"contents\": [ { \"custom_reference\": \"b9fa91b0-0dd0-4dd5-986f-363fa8cb2386\", \"package_size_reference\": null, \"weight\": { \"value\": 2.40, \"unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"dimensions\": { \"unit\": \"Cm\", \"width\": 15.0, \"height\": 15.5, \"length\": 20.0 }, \"description\": \"Jeans\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 8.99, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"sku\": \"SKU09876\", \"model\": \"MOD-009\", \"country_of_origin\": \"PT\", \"harmonisation_code\": \"09021000\", \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"quantity\": 2, \"unit\": \"Box\", \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"Category\", \"value\": \"Menswear\", \"type\": \"string\" } ], \"label_properties\": null, \"Contents\": null } ], \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"Origin\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460864\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Mark\", \"last_name\": \"Brunell\", \"contact_details\": { \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"mark@62-7.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"1\", \"property_name\": \"Frank's Place\", \"address_line1\": \"Zappa Avenue\", \"address_line2\": \"Off Rock Road\", \"address_line3\": \"Off Heavy Crescent\", \"locality\": \"Manchester\", \"region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"postal_code\": \"M2 6LW\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"custom_reference\": \"21bbd58a-6dec-4097-9106-17501ddca38d\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460865\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Gardner\", \"last_name\": \"Minshew\", \"middle_name\": null, \"position\": null, \"contact_details\": { \"landline\": null, \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"gminshew@test.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"8\", \"property_name\": null, \"address_line1\": \"Norbert Road\", \"address_line2\": \"Bertwistle\", \"address_line3\": null, \"locality\": \"Preston\", \"region\": \"Lancashire\", \"postal_code\": \"PR4 5LE\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\", \"lat_long\": null } ] } { \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"message\": \"Shipment created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } Step 3 (Optional) Adding Paperless Documents Add Paperless Document Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/{shipment_reference} Paperless documents are customer-generated documents that are transmitted to carriers as part of a shipment's data, as opposed to being generated separately by the carrier. They can help to make your workflows more efficient, reducing steps in the manifest process and enabling you to attach document data to a shipment directly. Note PRO's paperless document functionality should not be confused with PRO's customs documents functionality. Paperless documents are added to the shipment before allocation and transmitted as part of that shipment's data, while customs documents are generated post-allocation and are intended to be printed before dispatch. For more information on working with customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Not all carriers support paperless trade. You can add paperless documents to an unallocated shipment via the Add Paperless Document endpoint. As a minimum, Add Paperless Document requests should include the document's file_format , document_type , and file_content (as a base64-encoded byte array). You can also add expiration and usage data if required. Once it has received the request, PRO attaches the document to the specified shipment and returns a unique reference for the paperless document. You can use this reference to retrieve details of the paperless document (via the Get Paperless Document endpoint), or delete the paperless document entirely (via the Remove Paperless Document endpoint). Note For full reference information on the Add Paperless Document endpoint, see the PRO v2 API Reference . For a user guide on working with paperless documents, see the Adding Paperless Documents page. Add Paperless Document Example The example shows a successful request to add a commercial_invoice paperless document to shipment sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . PRO has responded with a paperless document reference of pd_00797582543150236528252876881920 .

Tip In PRO, carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all shipments involving dangerous items. Like other allocation endpoints, Allocate Shipments with Service Groups allocates based on your organisation's custom allocation rules. PRO enables you to configure custom allocation rules for individual carrier services - such as valid package dimensions, maximum shipment value, and geographical availability - via the UI. The Allocate Shipments with Service Groups endpoint can be used to allocate multiple shipments simultaneously. The request body should contain an array of one or more shipment {reference} s to be allocated. Once the request is received, SortedPRO queues all of the listed shipments for allocation to the cheapest eligible carrier within the service group, based on your default rules. The system then returns an Allocate Shipments Response. Note For full reference information on the Allocate Shipments with Service Group endpoint, see the Allocate Shipments with Service Group section of the API reference. For a user guide on allocating within carrier service groups, see the Allocating Within a Carrier Service Group section of the PRO API User Guide. For a user guide on configuring carrier service groups, see the Managing Carrier Service Groups section of the Sorted Admin Portal User Guide. Allocate Shipments with Shipment Group Example The example shows a request to allocate three shipments via default rules. Two have been successfully queued for allocation, but one was rejected due to an invalid shipment {reference} . Allocate Shipments by Shipment Group Request Allocate Shipments by Shipment Group Response PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/allocate/servicegroup \"shipments\": [ \"sp_10014418679662051328667654221112\", \"sp_10014418692546953216098308745978\", \"sp_10014418709726822400232323009988\" ] \"service_group\": \"nextDayCarrierGroup\", { \"message\": \"2 shipment(s) queued for allocation successfully. 1 shipment(s) rejected for allocation.\", \"queued\": [ \"sp_10014418679662051328667654221112\", \"sp_10014418692546953216098308745978\" ], \"rejected\": [ { \"code\": \"shipment_not_found\", \"message\": \"The shipment cannot be found\", \"references\": [ \"sp_10014418709726822400232323009988\" ] } ], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://beta.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_10014418709726822400232323009988\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_10014418709726822400232323009988\", \"type\": \"rejected\" } ] } Step 5: Getting Shipment Labels Get Labels Endpoint GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/{shipmentReference}/{contentType}/{dpi} When a shipment is allocated, SortedPRO generates labels for each item of contents in that shipment. You can retrieve these delivery labels via the Get Labels endpoint. The Get Labels endpoint takes shipment {reference} , {contentType} , and {dpi} as path parameters, where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to get labels for, {contentType} is an optional property indicating the file format required (either PDF or ZPL), and {dpi} an optional property indicating is the resolution required. PRO returns all package labels associated with that shipment as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to the format and resolution requested. Note For full reference information on the Get Labels endpoint, see the Get Labels page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving labels in PRO, see the Getting Labels page. Get Labels Example The example shows a request to get PDF labels for a shipment with a {reference} of sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 . The file data in the response has been truncated for clarity. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the label. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Example Get Labels Request Example Get Labels Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/sp_00668400124857422605561635799040/pdf { \"file\": (Base64 file data), \"content_type\": \"text/plain\", \"document_type\": \"label\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 6 (Optional): Getting Customs Docs Get Customs Documents Endpoint GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/{shipment_reference} When shipping internationally, SortedPRO automatically determines whether customs documentation is necessary for a shipment, and generates documents where required. You can retrieve customs documentation via the Get Customs Documents endpoint. The Get Customs Documents endpoint takes a shipment {reference} as a path parameter. If CN22/CN23 or commercial invoice documents exist for the specified shipment, then PRO returns these documents as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to a PDF document. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the documents. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Documents endpoint, see the Get Customs Documents page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving customs documents and commercial invoices in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Get Customs Documents Example This example shows a Get Customs Documents response for shipment sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 . PRO has returned a CN22 document. Get Customs Documents Request Get Customs Documents Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 { \"file\": {Base64 file contents}, \"content_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"document_type\": \"cn22\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 7: Creating the Shipment Group Create Shipment Group Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups Next, you'll need to create a shipment group by making a Create Shipment Group request. The body of the request should contain a list of up to 10,000 shipments that you want to add to the group, and an optional custom_reference that can be used as a unique identifier for the group. Once it has received and validated the request, PRO creates the shipment group and returns a Resource Result containing the group reference . This reference will be used as an identifier for the group later on in the process. Note For a user guide on creating shipment groups see the Creating Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Create Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Create Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to add three shipments to a group. Create Shipment Group Request Create Shipment Group Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/ { \"custom_reference\": \"Example123\", \"shipments\": [ \"sp_00013464648910021776641789788160\", \"sp_00013464648910021776641789784435\", \"sp_00013464648910021776641789790773\" ] } { \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"custom_reference\": \"Example123\", \"version\": 79, \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"type\": \"shipment_group\" } ] } Step 8: Updating the Shipment Group Update Shipment Group Endpoint PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups You can amend the shipments in a shipment group using the Update Shipment Group endpoint. For example, you may have added extra shipments to a particular warehouse cage, and you want to amend the corresponding shipment group to also contain those shipments. The Update Shipment Group request should contain the reference of the group you want to amend and optional add_shipments and/or remove_shipments properties listing the shipments that you want to either add to or remove from the group. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a Resource Result confirming the result of the operation. Note For a user guide on updating shipment groups, see the Editing Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Update Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Update Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to update the group created in the previous example. Three new shipments have been added to the group, while one of the group's existing shipments has been removed. Update Shipment Group Request Update Shipment Group Response PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/ { \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"add_shipments\": [ \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134016\", \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134045\", \"sp_00682731282010871067439042134076\" ], \"remove_shipments\": [ \"sp_00013464648910021776641789788160\" ] } { \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 updated successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://beta.sorted.com/pro/shipments/groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"type\": \"shipment_group\" } ] } Step 9: Locking the Shipment Group Lock Shipment Group Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/lock You'll need to lock your shipment group via the Lock Shipment Group endpoint before you can get a collection note for it. Locking a shipment group means that it can no longer be edited. Note Locked shipment groups can be unlocked via the Unlock Shipment Group endpoint, making it possible to add or remove shipments from the group. For a user guide on locking shipment groups, see the Locking Shipment Groups section of the Editing Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Lock Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Lock Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to lock shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 .

Unlocking a shipment group means that the shipment group is again open for editing. Note Unlocked shipment groups can be locked via the Lock Shipment Group endpoint. For a user guide on unlocking shipment groups, see the Unlocking Shipment Groups section of the Editing Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Unlock Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Unlock Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to unlock shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 . Unlock Shipment Group Request Unlock Shipment Group Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632/unlock { \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 unlocked successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"type\": \"shipment_group\" } ] } Step 11: Getting Collection Notes for the Shipment Group Get Shipment Group Collection Note Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/collection_notes/shipment_group/{reference} In PRO, a collection note (sometimes referred to as a driver's manifest) is a document listing items that are to be collected by a driver. It is intended to be printed and given to the driver at the point of collection. The Get Shipment Group Collection Note endpoint returns a collection note document listing all of the shipments in the specified group. The group must be locked in order for a collection note to be generated. Note For a user guide on getting shipment group collection notes, see the Getting Collection Notes for a Shipment Group section of the Getting Collection Notes page. For full reference information on the Get Shipment Group Collection Note endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Get Shipment Group Collection Note Call The example shows a successful request to get a collection note for shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 . Get Shipment Group Collection Note Request Get Shipment Group Collection Note Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/collection_notes/shipment_group/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 { \"file\": {Base64 file contents}, \"content_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"document_type\": \"collection_note\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 12: Manifesting the Shipment Group Manifest Shipment Group Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/manifest Once you've added your shipments to the shipment group, you're ready to manifest it. To manifest a shipment group, use the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint. In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting shipment data to carriers. The Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint queues all of the shipments in the specified shipment group for manifest. Note For a user guide on manifesting shipments, see the Manifesting Shipments page. For full reference information on the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Manifest Shipment Group Example The example shows a successful request to manifest a shipment group. Manifest Shipment Group Request Manifest Shipments Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632/manifest { \"manifest_results\": [ { \"reference\": \"ma_01277530195429043576331230117888\", \"carrier\": { \"reference\": \"CustomerX_DPD\", \"name\": \"DPD\", \"service_reference\": \"CX_DPDND\", \"service_name\": \"DPD Next Day (Parcel)\" }, \"message\": \"2 shipments queued for manifest successfully\", \"state\": \"manifesting\", \"shipment_count\": 2, \"_links\": [] } ] } Step 13: Closing the Shipment Group Close Shipment Group Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/close The Close Shipment Group endpoint permanently closes a specified shipment group. It is intended to be used when all shipments within a group have been either manifested or cancelled and the group is no longer required. A shipment group must be locked before it can be closed. Note Once closed, shipment groups cannot be re-opened. If you want to prevent a shipment group from being edited but may still need to make changes to it later, use the Lock Shipment Group endpoint. For a user guide on closing shipment groups, see the Closing Shipment Groups page. Example Close Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to close shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 .

The Allocate and Manifest integration design makes it easy for your organisation to manage deliveries across multiple carriers. Note This page provides help and support for PRO version 2 (Shipments). As PRO v2 is currently in development, content may be updated as and when necessary. For support on PRO v1 (Consignments), click here . The Allocate and Manifest design is most useful to your business if: You have a warehouse / fulfilment centre from which your carriers make regular, scheduled collections. You use a static delivery promise (e.g. Next day delivery before 5pm). You want to keep your business logic and technology architecture as simple as possible. There are six steps to the design: Create the shipment - Use the Create Shipment endpoint to record the details of your new shipment. (Optional) Add Paperless Documents - Use the Add Paperless Document endpoint to add documents to the shipment's data. Allocate the shipment - Use the Allocate Shipment endpoint to assign your shipment to a suitable carrier service. Get the shipment's labels - Use the Get Labels endpoint to get the delivery label for your shipment. (Optional) Get customs documents for the shipment - Use the Get Customs Documents to generate printable customs documents for international shipments. Manifest the shipment - Use the Manifest Shipment endpoint to send shipment data to the selected carrier. This section gives more detail on each step of the design and provides worked examples. Step 1: Creating the Shipment Create Shipments Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments The first step toward manifesting a shipment is to create that shipment in SortedPRO. Shipments are created using the Create Shipment endpoint, which takes information about new shipments, adds them to the database, and returns a link to the newly-created shipment, including its {reference} . A newly created shipment has a {state} of unallocated . As a minimum, the Create Shipments endpoint requires you to send details of the contents of the shipment and its origin and destination addresses. You must also specify whether the shipment is on_demand (i.e. will require an ad-hoc carrier collection to be booked) or scheduled (i.e. will be picked up as part of a regularly scheduled carrier collection). Note For full reference information on the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Create Shipment page of the API reference. For a user guide explaining the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Creating Shipments page. Create Shipments Example This example shows the creation of a fairly standard shipment. In this case, we have an outbound shipment comprising a single package. After receiving the request, PRO returns a shipment {reference} of sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . Many of PRO's functions require you to provide this shipment {reference} as a parameter. Create Shipment Request Create Shipment Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments { \"shipment_type\": \"on_demand\", \"contents\": [ { \"custom_reference\": \"b9fa91b0-0dd0-4dd5-986f-363fa8cb2386\", \"package_size_reference\": null, \"weight\": { \"value\": 2.40, \"unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"dimensions\": { \"unit\": \"Cm\", \"width\": 15.0, \"height\": 15.5, \"length\": 20.0 }, \"description\": \"Jeans\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 8.99, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"sku\": \"SKU09876\", \"model\": \"MOD-009\", \"country_of_origin\": \"PT\", \"harmonisation_code\": \"09021000\", \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"quantity\": 2, \"unit\": \"Box\", \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"Category\", \"value\": \"Menswear\", \"type\": \"string\" } ], \"label_properties\": null, \"Contents\": null } ], \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"Origin\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460864\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Mark\", \"last_name\": \"Brunell\", \"contact_details\": { \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"mark@62-7.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"1\", \"property_name\": \"Frank's Place\", \"address_line1\": \"Zappa Avenue\", \"address_line2\": \"Off Rock Road\", \"address_line3\": \"Off Heavy Crescent\", \"locality\": \"Manchester\", \"region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"postal_code\": \"M2 6LW\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"custom_reference\": \"21bbd58a-6dec-4097-9106-17501ddca38d\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460865\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Gardner\", \"last_name\": \"Minshew\", \"middle_name\": null, \"position\": null, \"contact_details\": { \"landline\": null, \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"gminshew@test.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"8\", \"property_name\": null, \"address_line1\": \"Norbert Road\", \"address_line2\": \"Bertwistle\", \"address_line3\": null, \"locality\": \"Preston\", \"region\": \"Lancashire\", \"postal_code\": \"PR4 5LE\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\", \"lat_long\": null } ] } { \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"message\": \"Shipment created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } Step 2 (Optional) Adding Paperless Documents Add Paperless Document Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/{shipment_reference} Paperless documents are customer-generated documents that are transmitted to carriers as part of a shipment's data, as opposed to being generated separately by the carrier. They can help to make your workflows more efficient, reducing steps in the manifest process and enabling you to attach document data to a shipment directly. Note PRO's paperless document functionality should not be confused with PRO's customs documents functionality. Paperless documents are added to the shipment before allocation and transmitted as part of that shipment's data, while customs documents are generated post-allocation and are intended to be printed before dispatch. For more information on working with customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Not all carriers support paperless trade. You can add paperless documents to an unallocated shipment via the Add Paperless Document endpoint. As a minimum, Add Paperless Document requests should include the document's file_format , document_type , and file_content (as a base64-encoded byte array). You can also add expiration and usage data if required. Once it has received the request, PRO attaches the document to the specified shipment and returns a unique reference for the paperless document. You can use this reference to retrieve details of the paperless document (via the Get Paperless Document endpoint), or delete the paperless document entirely (via the Remove Paperless Document endpoint). Note For full reference information on the Add Paperless Document endpoint, see the PRO v2 API Reference . For a user guide on working with paperless documents, see the Adding Paperless Documents page. Add Paperless Document Example The example shows a successful request to add a commercial_invoice paperless document to shipment sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . PRO has responded with a paperless document reference of pd_00797582543150236528252876881920 . Example Add Paperless Document Request Example Add Paperless Document Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 { \"file_format\": \"pdf\", \"document_type\": \"commercial_invoice\", \"expiration\": \"2021-09-01T06:00:00+00:00\", \"file_content\": (Base64 document data), \"usage\": \"electronic_trade\" } { \"reference\": \"pd_00797582543150236528252876881920\", \"message\": \"Paperless Document pd_00797582543150236528252876881920 added successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api-int.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/pd_00797582543150236528252876881920\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"pd_00797582543150236528252876881920\", \"type\": \"paperless_document\" }, { \"href\": \"https://api-int.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00797580869643167594270016798720\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00797580869643167594270016798720\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } Step 3: Allocating the Shipment using Default Rules Allocate Shipment PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate To allocate a shipment based on your organisation's custom allocation rules, use the Allocate Shipment endpoint. PRO enables you to configure custom allocation rules for individual carrier services - such as valid package dimensions, maximum shipment value, and geographical availability - via the UI. Once the request is received, SortedPRO uses your shipping rules and modes to ascertain the most suitable carrier service for the shipment, and then allocates the shipment to that service. The system then returns an Allocate Shipments Response. Note For more information on the wider process PRO uses to allocate shipments, see the Selecting a Carrier Service section of the Allocating Shipments page. For more information on configuring and using shipping rules, see the Managing Shipping Rules page of the UI user guide. For more information on configuring and using shipping modes, see the Managing Shipping Modes page of the UI user guide. Allocate Shipments with Default Rules Example The example shows a successful request to allocate a shipment with a {reference} of sp_01017652898121961272041674506240 via the Allocate Shipment endpoint.

You can retrieve these delivery labels via the Get Labels endpoint. The Get Labels endpoint takes shipment {reference} , {contentType} , and {dpi} as path parameters, where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to get labels for, {contentType} is an optional property indicating the file format required (either PDF or ZPL), and {dpi} an optional property indicating is the resolution required. PRO returns all package labels associated with that shipment as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to the format and resolution requested. Note For full reference information on the Get Labels endpoint, see the Get Labels page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving labels in PRO, see the Getting Labels page. Get Labels Example The example shows a request to get PDF labels for a shipment with a {reference} of sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 . The file data in the response has been truncated for clarity. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the label. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Example Get Labels Request Example Get Labels Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/sp_00668400124857422605561635799040/pdf { \"file\": (Base64 file data), \"content_type\": \"text/plain\", \"document_type\": \"label\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 5 (Optional): Getting Customs Docs Get Customs Documents Endpoint GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/{shipment_reference} When shipping internationally, SortedPRO automatically determines whether customs documentation is necessary for a shipment, and generates documents where required. You can retrieve customs documentation via the Get Customs Documents endpoint. The Get Customs Documents endpoint takes a shipment {reference} as a path parameter. If CN22/CN23 or commercial invoice documents exist for the specified shipment, then PRO returns these documents as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to a PDF document. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the documents. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Documents endpoint, see the Get Customs Documents page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving customs documents and commercial invoices in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Get Customs Documents Example This example shows a Get Customs Documents response for shipment sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 . PRO has returned a CN22 document. Get Customs Documents Request Get Customs Documents Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 { \"file\": {Base64 file contents}, \"content_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"document_type\": \"cn22\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 6: Manifesting the Shipment Manifest Shipments Endpoint PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/manifest Once you've created a shipment, allocated it to a carrier service and printed labels for it, you're ready to manifest it. To manifest a shipment, use the Manifest Shipment endpoint. In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting the shipment data to carriers. The Manifest Shipment endpoint enables you to manifest an individual shipment. Once PRO has received the request, it attempts to manifest the specified shipment and returns a manifest_result containing a unique reference for the manifest item and details of the carrier and service that the shipment was manifested with. Caution Every successful request to a manifest endpoint results in data being transmitted to the carrier. Therefore, Sorted strongly advise that manifesting of scheduled shipments is aligned with the carrier collection times from the warehouse. Note For full reference information on the Manifest Shipment endpoint, see the Manifest Shipment page of the PRO v2 API Reference. For a user guide on manifesting shipments, see the Manifesting Shipments page. Manifest Shipment Example The example shows a successful request to manifest shipment sp_00673267200365953327505217421312 .

A common use case for shipment groups is to match operational flows, such as adding multiple shipments to a cage or trailer to be taken in a batch by a carrier. For example, suppose that you allocate 500 shipments to Carrier X, which are all loaded on to the same outbound trailer in a cage. The Shipment Groups design enables you to add each shipment to a group corresponding to that cage, before manifesting the entire group in a single API call. Note This page provides help and support for PRO version 2 (Shipments). As PRO v2 is currently in development, content may be updated as and when necessary. For support on PRO v1 (Consignments), click here . There are ten steps to the design: Create the shipment - Use the Create Shipment endpoint to record the details of your new shipments. (Optional) Add Paperless Documents - Use the Add Paperless Document endpoint to add documents to shipment data. Allocate the shipment - Use the Allocate Shipment endpoint to assign your shipment to a suitable carrier service. Create the shipment group - Use the Create Shipment Group endpoint to create the shipment group and add your shipments to it. (Optional) Update the shipment group - Use the Update Shipment Group endpoint to add or remove shipments from your shipment group. Lock the shipment group - Use the Lock Shipment Group endpoint to prevent further changes from being made to the group. Get a collection note for the shipment group - Use the Get Collection Note by Shipment Group endpoint to generate a driver's manifest containing all shipments in the group. Get the shipment's labels - Use the Get Labels endpoint to get delivery label for the shipment. (Optional) Get customs documents for the shipment - Use the Get Customs Documents to generate printable customs documents for international shipments. Manifest the shipment - Use the Manifest Shipment by Shipment Group endpoint to send shipment data to the selected carriers. This section gives more detail on each step of the design and provides worked examples. Step 1: Creating the Shipment Create Shipments Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments The first step toward manifesting a shipment is to create that shipment in SortedPRO. Shipments are created using the Create Shipment endpoint, which takes information about new shipments, adds them to the database, and returns a link to the newly-created shipment, including its {reference} . A newly created shipment has a {state} of unallocated . As a minimum, the Create Shipments endpoint requires you to send details of the contents of the shipment and its origin and destination addresses. You must also specify whether the shipment is on_demand (i.e. will require an ad-hoc carrier collection to be booked) or scheduled (i.e. will be picked up as part of a regularly scheduled carrier collection). Note For full reference information on the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Create Shipment page of the API reference. For a user guide explaining the Create Shipment endpoint, see the Creating Shipments page. Create Shipments Example This example shows the creation of a fairly standard shipment. In this case, we have an outbound shipment comprising a single package. After receiving the request, PRO returns a shipment {reference} of sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . Many of PRO's functions require you to provide this shipment {reference} as a parameter. Create Shipment Request Create Shipment Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments { \"shipment_type\": \"on_demand\", \"contents\": [ { \"custom_reference\": \"b9fa91b0-0dd0-4dd5-986f-363fa8cb2386\", \"package_size_reference\": null, \"weight\": { \"value\": 2.40, \"unit\": \"Kg\" }, \"dimensions\": { \"unit\": \"Cm\", \"width\": 15.0, \"height\": 15.5, \"length\": 20.0 }, \"description\": \"Jeans\", \"value\": { \"amount\": 8.99, \"currency\": \"GBP\" }, \"sku\": \"SKU09876\", \"model\": \"MOD-009\", \"country_of_origin\": \"PT\", \"harmonisation_code\": \"09021000\", \"shipping_terms\": \"fca\", \"quantity\": 2, \"unit\": \"Box\", \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"Category\", \"value\": \"Menswear\", \"type\": \"string\" } ], \"label_properties\": null, \"Contents\": null } ], \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"Origin\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460864\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Mark\", \"last_name\": \"Brunell\", \"contact_details\": { \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"mark@62-7.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"1\", \"property_name\": \"Frank's Place\", \"address_line1\": \"Zappa Avenue\", \"address_line2\": \"Off Rock Road\", \"address_line3\": \"Off Heavy Crescent\", \"locality\": \"Manchester\", \"region\": \"Greater Manchester\", \"postal_code\": \"M2 6LW\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"custom_reference\": \"21bbd58a-6dec-4097-9106-17501ddca38d\", \"contact\": { \"reference\": \"co_9953035290535460865\", \"title\": \"Mr\", \"first_name\": \"Gardner\", \"last_name\": \"Minshew\", \"middle_name\": null, \"position\": null, \"contact_details\": { \"landline\": null, \"mobile\": \"+447495747987\", \"email\": \"gminshew@test.com\" } }, \"property_number\": \"8\", \"property_name\": null, \"address_line1\": \"Norbert Road\", \"address_line2\": \"Bertwistle\", \"address_line3\": null, \"locality\": \"Preston\", \"region\": \"Lancashire\", \"postal_code\": \"PR4 5LE\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\", \"lat_long\": null } ] } { \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"message\": \"Shipment created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00595452779180472847666078547968\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } Step 2 (Optional) Adding Paperless Documents Add Paperless Document Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/{shipment_reference} Paperless documents are customer-generated documents that are transmitted to carriers as part of a shipment's data, as opposed to being generated separately by the carrier. They can help to make your workflows more efficient, reducing steps in the manifest process and enabling you to attach document data to a shipment directly. Note PRO's paperless document functionality should not be confused with PRO's customs documents functionality. Paperless documents are added to the shipment before allocation and transmitted as part of that shipment's data, while customs documents are generated post-allocation and are intended to be printed before dispatch. For more information on working with customs documents in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Not all carriers support paperless trade. You can add paperless documents to an unallocated shipment via the Add Paperless Document endpoint. As a minimum, Add Paperless Document requests should include the document's file_format , document_type , and file_content (as a base64-encoded byte array). You can also add expiration and usage data if required. Once it has received the request, PRO attaches the document to the specified shipment and returns a unique reference for the paperless document. You can use this reference to retrieve details of the paperless document (via the Get Paperless Document endpoint), or delete the paperless document entirely (via the Remove Paperless Document endpoint). Note For full reference information on the Add Paperless Document endpoint, see the PRO v2 API Reference . For a user guide on working with paperless documents, see the Adding Paperless Documents page. Add Paperless Document Example The example shows a successful request to add a commercial_invoice paperless document to shipment sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 . PRO has responded with a paperless document reference of pd_00797582543150236528252876881920 . Example Add Paperless Document Request Example Add Paperless Document Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/sp_00595452779180472847666078547968 { \"file_format\": \"pdf\", \"document_type\": \"commercial_invoice\", \"expiration\": \"2021-09-01T06:00:00+00:00\", \"file_content\": (Base64 document data), \"usage\": \"electronic_trade\" } { \"reference\": \"pd_00797582543150236528252876881920\", \"message\": \"Paperless Document pd_00797582543150236528252876881920 added successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api-int.sorted.com/pro/documents/paperless/pd_00797582543150236528252876881920\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"pd_00797582543150236528252876881920\", \"type\": \"paperless_document\" }, { \"href\": \"https://api-int.sorted.com/pro/shipments/sp_00797580869643167594270016798720\", \"rel\": \"shipment\", \"reference\": \"sp_00797580869643167594270016798720\", \"type\": \"shipment\" } ] } Step 3: Allocating the Shipment using Default Rules Allocate Shipment PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/allocate To allocate a shipment based on your organisation's custom allocation rules, use the Allocate Shipment endpoint. PRO enables you to configure custom allocation rules for individual carrier services - such as valid package dimensions, maximum shipment value, and geographical availability - via the UI. Once the request is received, SortedPRO uses your shipping rules and modes to ascertain the most suitable carrier service for the shipment, and then allocates the shipment to that service. The system then returns an Allocate Shipments Response. Note For more information on the wider process PRO uses to allocate shipments, see the Selecting a Carrier Service section of the Allocating Shipments page. For more information on configuring and using shipping rules, see the Managing Shipping Rules page of the UI user guide. For more information on configuring and using shipping modes, see the Managing Shipping Modes page of the UI user guide. Allocate Shipments with Default Rules Example The example shows a successful request to allocate a shipment with a {reference} of sp_01017652898121961272041674506240 via the Allocate Shipment endpoint. PRO has selected a service and returned tracking_references for the shipment.

The body of the request should contain a list of up to 10,000 shipments that you want to add to the group, and an optional custom_reference that can be used as a unique identifier for the group. Once it has received and validated the request, PRO creates the shipment group and returns a Resource Result containing the group reference . This reference will be used as an identifier for the group later on in the process. Note For a user guide on creating shipment groups see the Creating Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Create Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Create Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to add three shipments to a group. Create Shipment Group Request Create Shipment Group Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/ { \"custom_reference\": \"Example123\", \"shipments\": [ \"sp_00013464648910021776641789788160\", \"sp_00013464648910021776641789784435\", \"sp_00013464648910021776641789790773\" ] } { \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"custom_reference\": \"Example123\", \"version\": 79, \"message\": \"Shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 created successfully\", \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"rel\": \"self\", \"reference\": \"sg_00679577652026749527919113797632\", \"type\": \"shipment_group\" } ] } Step 5: Updating the Shipment Group Update Shipment Group Endpoint PUT https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups You can amend the shipments in a shipment group using the Update Shipment Group endpoint. For example, you may have added extra shipments to a particular warehouse cage, and you want to amend the corresponding shipment group to also contain those shipments. The Update Shipment Group request should contain the reference of the group you want to amend and optional add_shipments and/or remove_shipments properties listing the shipments that you want to either add to or remove from the group. Once it has received the request, PRO returns a Resource Result confirming the result of the operation. Note For a user guide on updating shipment groups, see the Editing Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Update Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

Locking a shipment group means that it can no longer be edited. Note Locked shipment groups can be unlocked via the Unlock Shipment Group endpoint, making it possible to add or remove shipments from the group. For a user guide on locking shipment groups, see the Locking Shipment Groups section of the Editing Shipment Groups page. For full reference information on the Lock Shipment Groups endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Lock Shipment Group Call The example shows a successful request to lock shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 .

It is intended to be printed and given to the driver at the point of collection. The Get Shipment Group Collection Note endpoint returns a collection note document listing all of the shipments in the specified group. The group must be locked in order for a collection note to be generated. Note For a user guide on getting shipment group collection notes, see the Getting Collection Notes for a Shipment Group section of the Getting Collection Notes page. For full reference information on the Get Shipment Group Collection Note endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Example Get Shipment Group Collection Note Call The example shows a successful request to get a collection note for shipment group sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 . Get Shipment Group Collection Note Request Get Shipment Group Collection Note Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/collection_notes/shipment_group/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632 { \"file\": {Base64 file contents}, \"content_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"document_type\": \"collection_note\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 8: Getting Shipment Labels Get Labels Endpoint GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/{shipmentReference}/{contentType}/{dpi} When a shipment is allocated, SortedPRO generates labels for each item of contents in that shipment. You can retrieve these delivery labels via the Get Labels endpoint. The Get Labels endpoint takes shipment {reference} , {contentType} , and {dpi} as path parameters, where {reference} is the unique reference of the shipment you want to get labels for, {contentType} is an optional property indicating the file format required (either PDF or ZPL), and {dpi} an optional property indicating is the resolution required. PRO returns all package labels associated with that shipment as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to the format and resolution requested. Note For full reference information on the Get Labels endpoint, see the Get Labels page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving labels in PRO, see the Getting Labels page. Get Labels Example The example shows a request to get PDF labels for a shipment with a {reference} of sp_00668400124857422605561635799040 . The file data in the response has been truncated for clarity. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the label. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Example Get Labels Request Example Get Labels Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/labels/sp_00668400124857422605561635799040/pdf { \"file\": (Base64 file data), \"content_type\": \"text/plain\", \"document_type\": \"label\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 9 (Optional): Getting Customs Docs Get Customs Documents Endpoint GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/{shipment_reference} When shipping internationally, SortedPRO automatically determines whether customs documentation is necessary for a shipment, and generates documents where required. You can retrieve customs documentation via the Get Customs Documents endpoint. The Get Customs Documents endpoint takes a shipment {reference} as a path parameter. If CN22/CN23 or commercial invoice documents exist for the specified shipment, then PRO returns these documents as a base64-encoded byte array that decodes to a PDF document. You will need to decode the file's Base64 data in order to view or print the documents. If you are unsure how to do so, see the MDN docs for more information. Note For full reference information on the Get Customs Documents endpoint, see the Get Customs Documents page of the API reference. For a user guide on retrieving customs documents and commercial invoices in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Get Customs Documents Example This example shows a Get Customs Documents response for shipment sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 . PRO has returned a CN22 document. Get Customs Documents Request Get Customs Documents Response GET https://api.sorted.com/pro/documents/sp_00670175533382557003917067812864 { \"file\": {Base64 file contents}, \"content_type\": \"application/pdf\", \"document_type\": \"cn22\", \"dpi\": 203 } Step 10: Manifesting the Shipment Manifest Shipment Group Endpoint POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/{reference}/manifest Once you've added your shipments to the shipment group, you're ready to manifest it. To manifest a shipment group, use the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint. In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting shipment data to carriers. The Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint queues all of the shipments in the specified shipment group for manifest. Note For a user guide on manifesting shipments, see the Manifesting Shipments page. For full reference information on the Manifest Shipments by Shipment Group endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference . Manifest Shipment Group Example The example shows a successful request to manifest a shipment group. Manifest Shipment Group Request Manifest Shipments Response POST https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipment_groups/sg_00679577652026749527919113797632/manifest { \"manifest_results\": [ { \"reference\": \"ma_01277530195429043576331230117888\", \"carrier\": { \"reference\": \"CustomerX_DPD\", \"name\": \"DPD\", \"service_reference\": \"CX_DPDND\", \"service_name\": \"DPD Next Day (Parcel)\" }, \"message\": \"2 shipments queued for manifest successfully\", \"state\": \"manifesting\", \"shipment_count\": 2, \"_links\": [] } ] }"

This page contains a brief overview of PRO version 2's APIs and explains how you can use them. API Collection Overview PRO's Shipments functionality was introduced in version 2 as an extension to the Consignments API suite used in version 1. PRO's Shipments API collection offers unparalleled flexibility, with support for on-demand collections from multiple locations (e.g. a ship-from-store model) as well the regular scheduled fulfilment centre collections supported in v1. PRO also offers the ability to group shipments together for ease of management, an improved dangerous goods specification and enhanced customs functionality, among many other features. Note For more information on the differences between the Shipments API suite used in v2 and the Consignments API suite used in v1, see the Consignments vs Shipments page. PRO's APIs enable you to: Manage Shipments - Create, update, clone and cancel shipment records, and manually modify shipment states. Allocate Shipments - Allocate shipments to the most appropriate carrier service <!--, allocate within a service group, manually filter services to allocate to, or allocate based on a previous delivery quote --> . Manage Quotes - Create and receive delivery quotes for shipments. Get Customs Docs - Get customs documents for allocated international shipments. Get Labels - Get delivery labels for an allocated shipment in either ZPL or PDF format. Manifest Shipments - Manually manifest one or more shipments, either individually or by manifesting a shipment group. Manage Shipment Groups - Group shipments together so they can be operated on as a single unit, and edit or delete shipment groups as required. Get Collection Notes - Retrieve collection notes (aka driver's manifest) by search query or by shipment group. <!--* **Track Shipments** - Return tracking updates for a given shipment.--> Note For example API call flows and reference information, see the PRO v2 API reference . Making an API Request in PRO This section explains the various API headers used when making a request to one of PRO's APIs. Example PRO Shipments API Headers x-api-key: [qwerrtyuiioop0987654321] Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/json Accept-Encoding: gzip x-api-version: 1.1 Authentication You must provide a valid API key in every call you make to PRO. When a new user account is created, PRO generates a unique API key and allocates it to the new user. You can view your API key in the PRO UI. Note PRO admins can manage users in the UI. For information on configuring PRO user accounts and permissions, see the Managing Users and Roles page of the Sorted Admin Portal Guide. To use your API key with PRO v2, include it in an x-api-key header when making calls. If you make an API call to PRO without including an API key, then PRO returns an error with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) . Formats PRO v2 only works with JSON data. This is a change from v1, which accepted XML requests and responses as well as JSON. If you provide an Accept header to indicate request format and/or a Content-Type format to indicate response format, then these keys must have a value of application/json . PRO will return an error if you provide any other values in these headers. If you do not provide Accept and/or Content-Type headers, then PRO uses its default value of application/json . PRO is designed to work with GZIP encoding. We strongly recommend that you provide an Accept-Encoding header with a value of gzip in all requests. Versioning You must provide an x-api-version header in all requests. The current API version is 1.1 . Note The API version provided in the x-api-version header is a purely technical property, and should not be confused with the version of PRO you are using. At present, the x-api-version should always 1.1 , irrespective of whether you are calling PRO v2 (Shipments) or PRO v1 (Consignments) endpoints. This is because both versions of PRO share certain back-end processes. Response Headers Depending on the content returned, PRO's responses may include the following headers: x-api-version - The version of the API that served the request. Content-Type - The format of the response body. This will ordinarily have the value application/json . Content-Encoding - If you request responses in GZIP format, the Content-Encoding response header returns a value of gzipped . Using the Sandbox Environment All of the URLs and examples given in this documentation relate to PRO's live production environment. However, PRO also offers a sandbox, enabling you to use a \"safe\" development environment in which you can integrate with PRO without running the risk of inadvertently transmitting data to carriers. The sandbox works in exactly the same way as the production environment, but is entirely self-contained and uses a separate dataset. In order to call APIs in the sandbox environment, you will first need to set up a sandbox API key. To call an API in the sandbox rather than the production environment, substitute the api.sorted.com/pro portion of the API's base URL with api.sorted.com/pro-sandbox and make sure to use your sandbox API key (as opposed to your production API key) in the x-api-key header when making the call. For example, to call the Create Shipment endpoint in the production environment, you would send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments . To call the same endpoint in the sandbox, you would send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro-sandbox/shipments .

This section explains how to retrieve customs documentation for your shipments, and how to add, retrieve, and remove paperless shipment documents. Customs Documents When a shipment is allocated, SortedPRO takes into account its origin and destination countries, the value of goods to be shipped, and the carrier service that will take the shipment to identify whether the shipment will need customs documentation. PRO can automatically generate CN22, CN23, and Commercial Invoice documents. PRO offers two endpoints to retrieve customs documents once they have been generated: Get Customs Documents retrieves all customs documents that have been generated for a particular shipment. Get Document retrieves a specific customs document. Paperless Documents PRO also supports paperless trade. Paperless documents are customer-generated documents (such as packing lists or certificates of conformity) that are transmitted to carriers as part of a shipment's data rather than being generated separately by the carrier. PRO offers three endpoints Documents Section Contents"

This section explains how to create, edit and use shipment groups. What is a Shipment Group? In SortedPRO, a shipment group is a collection of one or more shipments that can be manifested in a single action. Shipment groups enable you to align your manifest processes with your operational flows. For example, suppose that you allocate 500 shipments to a particular carrier and your distribution centre places those shipments into a cage to be loaded onto the carrier's outbound trailer. By creating a shipment group corresponding to that carrier's cage and then adding the relevant shipments to it, you could manifest all the shipments that the carrier will take on that trailer in a single API call.

This section explains the various ways in which you can get delivery quotes for a shipment. What Is a Quote In PRO? In PRO, delivery quotes are generally used outside of a \"regular\" shipment allocation workflow, as a means of managing shipments that require manual intervention. For example, your customer service teams might want to get quotes for an expedited delivery on a shipment that was missed by a carrier and so did not meet its delivery promise. PRO's Quotes API enables you to get delivery quotes for as-yet uncreated shipments. All Quotes endpoints return one or more quote objects, of which each represents an offer for carriage of a shipment with a specific carrier service. Each quote can be uniquely identified by a reference . Quote Endpoints in PRO PRO has two endpoints that take the details of an as-yet uncreated shipment and return quotes: Create Quote can return quotes from any suitable carrier service. To call Create Quote , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/quote . Create Quote by Service Group returns quotes from eligible services in the specified carrier service group. To call Create Quote by Service Group , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/quote/service_group/{group_ref} , where {group_ref} is the unique reference of the service group you want to get quotes within. Carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. For information on configuring carrier service groups in PRO, see the Managing Carrier Service Groups section of the Sorted Admin Portal User Guide. For both endpoints, the request body should use the same structure as a Create Shipment request. Note Both the Create Quote and Create Quote by Service Group endpoints take a shipment object in the body of the request. However, they do not create shipments in and of themselves. In order to allocate to one of the quotes returned by these endpoints, you would need to first create the shipment. For more information on creating shipments, see the Creating Shipments page. Creating Quotes As a minimum, the Create Quote and Create Quote by Service Group endpoints require you to send the following information in the request body: shipment_type - Specifies whether the shipment will be on_demand (i.e. will require an ad-hoc carrier collection to be booked) or scheduled (i.e. will be picked up as part of a regularly scheduled carrier collection ). contents - The contents of the shipment itself. addresses - All shipments require both origin and destination addresses. However, there are lots of optional properties you can send when requesting quotes for a potential shipment, including: Your own custom reference for the shipment. Required shipping and delivery dates. The order date. Customs documentation for international shipments. For more information on using customs documentation in PRO, see the Getting Shipment Documents page. Shipment direction. Custom label properties. Tenant and channel. Metadata. PRO metadata enables you to use custom fields to record additional data about a shipment. Tags. Allocation tags enable you to filter the list of carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For more information on allocation tags, see the Using Shipment Tags page. Adding optional properties when you request quotes for a shipment can help you to filter the list of quotes you receive down to the most appropriate carrier services. Caution You should exercise caution when using the required_delivery_date and required_shipping_date parameters to specify dates for your shipment. These parameters limit delivery options for the shipment, meaning that it can only be allocated to carrier services that would be able to ship it within the specified required_shipping_date range and / or deliver it by the specified required_delivery_date range. If the dates you specify are too restrictive, there may not be any carrier services available to take the shipment, which would result in a limited selection of quote results. As such, you should only specify shipping and delivery dates where it is necessary to do so. The Quote Result Once it has received a request from either the Create Quote endpoint or the Create Quote by Service Group endpoint, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes a summary of the shipment details submitted, a list of quote objects, and a list of excluded_services (that is, eligible services for which it was not possible to obtain a delivery quote). Each quote object contains the following information: A unique reference for the quote in the format qu_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx . Creation and expiry dates. Details of the relevant carrier and carrier service. Confirmation of collection and delivery dates. Pricing information. At this point, you would be able to display the relevant quote information to your customer service operative. Note The quote reference begins with qu and can be found in the quotes.reference property of the Quote Result. It is not to be confused with the Quote Result's own reference , which begins with qc and is a unique reference for the entire quote response rather than a selectable quote. Example Quote The example below shows a Create Quote request for a shipment. Note that PRO has returned two quotes, with a further service excluded as it cannot meet the delivery promise.

This section explains how to create, retrieve and edit shipments. What Is a Shipment? In the context of PRO, the term \"shipment\" refers to a collection of one or more items that are shipped from the same origin address, to the same destination address, on behalf of the same Sorted customer, using the same carrier service, on the same day. Each shipment object contains details of the shipment's current state (for example ready_to_ship or dispatched ), its contents, its origin address, and its delivery address, alongside numerous optional properties. You can create and edit shipments via PRO version 2's Shipments API. Shipments were introduced to PRO in v2 as an extension of the Consignment object, which was used in v1 to represent items being shipped together. For a comparison of shipments and consignments, see the Consignments vs Shipments page. Note This section covers managing shipments using PRO's APIs. For an overview of working with shipments in the UI, see the Creating New Shipments and Managing Existing Shipments pages of the Sorted Admin Portal Guide.

This section explains how to use the Manifest Shipment endpoint. Manifesting Overview In the context of SortedPRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting shipment data to carriers. It is the final step of many PRO workflows. You can only manifest shipments that are in a state of allocated , manifest_failed , or ready_to_ship . If you attempt to manifest a shipment that is not in one of these states then PRO returns an error. Caution Every successful request to a manifest endpoint transmits data to a carrier. Therefore, Sorted strongly advise that you time your manifest requests to align with carrier collection times. Manifesting a shipment changes its state to manifested . At this point the carrier is aware of the shipment, and will collect it unless otherwise advised. In order to prevent the shipment being shipped, you would need to cancel it. Note For more information on cancelling shipments, see the Cancelling Shipments page. Once a shipment is manifested you should also look to print labels for the shipment, if you have not already done so. See the Getting Shipment Labels page for an explanation of how to retrieve package labels. Note To check a particular shipment's manifest status, make a Get Shipment call. The shipment's state field indicates whether the shipment is manifesting or manifested . Manifesting a Shipment The Manifest Shipment endpoint enables you to manifest an individual shipment. To call Manifest Shipment , send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/{reference}/manifest , where {reference} is the unique reference for the shipment you want to manifest. Once PRO has received the request, it attempts to manifest the specified shipment and returns a manifest_result containing the following information: A unique reference for the manifest item. Details of the carrier and service that the shipment was manifested with. A message providing details of the result. The current state of the shipment as a result of the manifest operation. Ordinarily, this would be manifesting . A link to the generated manifest. Note For full reference information on the Manifest Shipment endpoint, see the PRO v2 API reference .

The Manifest Shipments by Query Endpoint The Manifest Shipments by Query endpoint enables you to manifest shipments using a query, rather than by providing shipment references directly. To call Manifest Shipments by Query , send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/pro/shipments/manifest/query . The body of the request should contain shipment search criteria. All properties are optional. You can use the following query fields: shipping_locations - A list of shipping location references. Only shipments originating from these locations will be selected. address_custom_reference - A specific address reference used to identify shipments. You can specify address custom_reference properties when creating a shipment. shipment_states - PRO will only select shipments in the specified state. labels_retrieved - A boolean value. If provided as true , PRO will only manifests those shipments for which labels have already been retrieved. required_shipping_date - PRO only matches those shipments shipping within the specified date range. carrier_reference - PRO only manifests those shipments bound for the specified carrier. carrier_service_reference - PRO only manifests those shipments bound for the specified carrier service. Caution If you specify both a carrier_reference and a carrier_service_reference , ensure that the specified service is offered by the specified carrier. If you select a service that is not offered by your specified carrier then PRO will not manifest any shipments. Once the request is received, PRO attempts to manifest any shipments that meet the specified criteria. The system then returns a Manifest Response. All of PRO's manifest endpoints return a Manifest Response detailing the outcome of the manifest request. The Manifest Response contains one or more manifest_result objects, of which each represents a manifest item and contains the following information: A unique reference for the manifest item. Details of the carrier and service that the shipment(s) were manifested or queued to be manifested with.

The number of shipments that PRO attempted to manifest. A link to the generated manifest. Each manifest item in the response contains shipments for a single carrier. If your request causes shipments to be queued for manifest with multiple carriers then PRO returns one manifest_result per carrier. Note For full reference information on the Manifest Shipments by Query endpoint, see the Shipments data contract. Manifest Shipments by Query Example The example shows a request to manifest all allocated shipments that have had their labels retrieved and are shipping from an address with the address_custom_reference 76dc0fd4-1788-48bf-978c-f8601411f9b1 on 23-07-2020.

This section provides an explanation of the PRO API error object and a reference list of the errors that PRO can return. Error Structure in PRO Errors codes in PRO have two levels - a top-level code corresponding to standard HTTP error codes and a \"child\" code giving more detail on the specifics of the problem. Note For a detailed breakdown of the error codes that PRO can return, see the List of Error Codes section. When an API request encounters an error, PRO returns an API Error object.

The label must be visible, legible where required, and with barcodes that can be read according to the Carrier's requirements (and machinery). SortedPRO can use ZPL and PDF​ formats, although ZPL is preferred to be received/sent due to its smaller data size. ​Labels tend to come in standard sizes, with the most common being 6\" x 4\" (152.4mm x 101.6mm). Labels may also be 8\" x 4\" (203.2mm x 101.6mm), or variants of standard paper sizes (A4/5/6, where each increment is half the size of the previous)​​​ Manifest A manifest is an electronic document containing shipment data that is exchanged between business partners.

Typically, rates are either set by a file, which lists costs, destinations and any surcharges, or requested via an API endpoint ​Shipment​​​ ​​​​​A shipment is a user-defined unit containing goods (single or multiple units) that requires transportation from one location to another. A colleciton of goods becomes a shipment when it leaves the consignor's location. A shipment is complete when it arrives at the consignee's destination.​​ Shipment ID (REACT) A REACT-generated unique identifier for a particular shipment that can be used throughout REACT's APIs Shipment State (REACT) A shipment's current status, updated as shipment events occur Shipment Filter (REACT) A list of shipment states, calculated events, and tags that acts as a webhook trigger. When a shipment meets any of these criteria, any webhooks configured for that filter will deploy Shipment Type (REACT) For example, delivery, return, pick up, drop off, combined drop off / pick up, or return drop off Shipping Location A pre-set address used by your organisation as an origin for outbound consignments and a destination for inbound consignments State Label (REACT) A custom snippet of text that can be used in place of a standard shipment state name.

This section explains how to use PRO's built-in tracking endpoints. Note Sorted's dedicated tracking product, REACT, enables you to provide a richer tracking experience to your customers. For more information on using REACT, see the REACT section. PRO Shipment Tracking Overview PRO's Tracking API is intended to drive simple web-based tracking pages. When the API is called, PRO returns a response listing the tracking events that have occurred since that shipment was dispatched. PRO enables you to get tracking events at either shipment or (where supported by the carrier) contents level: In shipment-level tracking, PRO returns tracking events for the entire shipment, without making a distinction between individual items of contents within that shipment. In contents-level tracking, PRO returns separate tracking events for every item of contents within the specified shipment. In addition, PRO enables you to get tracking events by both a shipment's PRO-generated unique {reference} or its user-defined {custom_reference} . Getting tracking information by {custom_reference} means that you can track shipments using your own internal references (assuming that you have added those references to your shipments as custom_references ). In total, PRO has four in-built shipment tracking endpoints: Get Tracking Events - Returns shipment-level tracking events by unique shipment {reference} . Get Tracking Events by Custom Reference - Returns shipment-level tracking events by {custom_reference} . Get Content-Level Tracking Events - Returns contents-level tracking events by unique shipment {reference} . Get Content-Level Tracking Events by Custom Reference - Returns contents-level tracking events by {custom_reference} . Note PRO's endpoints that return tracking information by custom reference may return details of more than one shipment, because shipment custom_references do not need to be unique. What Is a Tracking Event? Tracking events are informational messages returned from carriers that provide details about the status of the shipment. All of PRO's tracking endpoints return standardised tracking events with the following properties: reference - A unique identifier for the tracking event. timestamp - The time and date that the tracking event occurred. received_timestamp - The time and date that the tracking event was received by Sorted. event_code - A unique identifier for the type of tracking event (for example delivered ). description - A description of the tracking event. signee - The name of the person who signed for the package, if applicable. location - The location of the tracking event, if applicable. lat_long The latitude and longitude of the location at which the event took place, where provided. Example Tracking Event { \"reference\": \"tr_00076982052571118537797193957408\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-07-23T17:42:00+01:00\", \"received_timestamp\": \"2019-07-23T16:45:44+00:00\", \"event_code\": \"delivered\", \"description\": \"The parcel was handed to the resident\", \"signee\": \"P. Jones\", \"location\": \"23 Baker Road, Wilmslow, Manchester\", \"lat_long\": null } PRO integrates with many carriers, and each carrier provides tracking events in different formats. As such, PRO translates all tracking events into a standard format, regardless of carrier service selected. A shipment's current shipment_state is derived from these tracking events. For example, a delivered tracking event will change the state of the relevant shipmenta to Delivered . Note For a full list and description of available shipment states, see the Shipment States page.

Note It is not a requirement that customers must use this endpoint, but it provides a convenient mechanism for preventing further changes without closing the group which is an irreversible operation. Unlock Shipment Group (M) This endpoint is used to unlock a shipment_group that was previously locked. Unlocking allows further changes to be made to the shipment_group. Close Shipment Group (M) This endpoint is used when all shipments within a shipment_group have been manifested or cancelled and the group is no longer required. The group will not be deleted but will be retained in a closed state . You may still retrieve the details of the shipment_group via the API for a period of time but will no longer be able to otherwise operate on the group. Caution This operation is not reversible.

They are generally used as a flexible means of excluding carrier services that would not be suitable for a particular shipment. Tagged shipments can only be allocated to those carrier services that have a matching tag. You can still allocate untagged shipments to a carrier service that has tags. For example, a retailer might use the UI to add a Flammables tag to all the carrier services that they wanted to use for flammable products. They would then add the Flammables tag to all shipments containing flammable products. PRO would only allocate those shipments tagged as Flammables to a shipment in the pre-approved Flammables list. Configuring Allocation Tags To tag a shipment, add the required tag into the shipment's tags property. The tags property is a simple array listing all the tags that apply to the shipment. The code sample below shows a tags property for a shipment that contains flammable materials, oil and alcohol. Example Tags Property \"Tags\": [ \"Flammables\", \"Oil\", \"Alcohol\" ] Tags Example Suppose that you set your carrier services up in the following way: You tag Carrier Service A with Alcohol You tag Carrier Service B with Flammables You tag Carrier Service C with Alcohol and Flammables You tag Carrier Service D with Oil You don't add any tags to Carrier Service E This configuration would produce the following results: Shipment with no tags - A B C D and E are returned Shipment tagged with Alcohol - A and C are returned Shipment tagged with Flammables - B and C are returned Shipment tagged with Alcohol and Flammables - C is returned Shipment tagged with Alcohol , Flammables , and Oil - No services are returned"

[!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] Introduction The Sorted delivery management platform is designed as an \"API-first\" system. Ordinarily, shipments are managed via an integration with customer’s warehouse / client management systems, utilising the Sorted APIs to perform actions such as shipment creation, allocation, manifesting, and reporting. Note For information on creating shipments using the Create Shipments API, see the Creating Shipments page of the API User Guide. However, there are certain cases where manual intervention is required, either as a workaround or as a convenient way to manage one-off shipment exceptions. For example, an order may need to be fulfilled urgently. By using the Portal to manage the shipment manually you can expedite the order by bypassing the conventional shipment creation/allocation/manifest process. The Create Shipments page enables you to create shipments manually. To access Create Shipments , select PRO > Create Shipment from the Dashboard. The Create Shipments Process The Create Shipment process has eight steps, five of which are optional: Select tenant Enter shipment details Enter package details Enter origin Enter destination Enter shipping dates (Optional) Provide customs documentation (Optional) Provide dangerous goods information (Optional) Note Mandatory data fields are marked with an asterisk and display a red border if any required data fields are left blank. Step 1 – Select Tenant If you have multi-tenancy enabled, the first step in the process is to use the Tenant/Channel Selection card to select the Tenant and Channel that the shipment belongs to. This step is not displayed for single-tenant customers, or for multi-tenanted users that are only assigned to a single tenant. In this case the relevant tenant is automatically selected in the background. Select an option from the Tenant drop-down menu and then click Next to display the Shipment Details card. Note Selecting an incorrect tenant may limit the shipping locations and carrier services that you can select for the shipment, and may also affect the rates applied. For more information on configuring multi-tenancy, see the Managing Tenants and Channels page. Step 2 – Enter Shipment Details The Shipment Details card enables you to select the shipment's type and direction, as well as specifying the measurement unit system and currency that the shipment should use. This step is mandatory for all shipments. To configure shipment details: Use the radio buttons to Select a shipment direction . There are two available options: Outbound – The shipment is taking goods from the retailer/3PL to the end customer. Inbound – The shipment is returning goods from the end customer to the retailer/3PL. Use the radio buttons to Select a shipment type . There are two available options: Scheduled – The shipment is intended to be allocated to a scheduled service (that is, a service whereby the pickup location has a regularly planned collection). On-Demand – The shipment's start location does not have a regular, scheduled collection. As such, the shipment is intended to be allocated to an ad-hoc service and will require the Portal to book a bespoke collection. Use the radio buttons to Select a unit system . You can select either Metric (cm / kg) or Imperial (in / lb) . The Portal uses the selected unit system throughout the rest of the shipment creation process. Select a Currency from the drop-down list. The Portal uses the selected currency throughout the rest of the shipment creation process. Optionally, enter a Custom Reference . The reference entered into this field populates the shipment's custom_reference field once the shipment is created. Click Next to display the Package Details card. Step 3 – Enter Package Details The Package Details card enables you to specify details of the shipment's packages. This step is mandatory for all shipments. Note A package is an item or a collection of items contained together for a shipment. A shipment can contain multiple packages. To configure package details: Enter a Custom Reference for the package. Optionally, enter the Quantity of This Package . If you enter a value greater than one then the Portal adds multiple identical packages to the shipment at the point of creation. Enter the Dimensions and Weight of the package. You can specify Length , Width , Height , and Weight . These values should be given in the unit system selected in the previous step. Enter the Package Value . This value should be given in the Currency selected in the previous step. Optionally, enter the package's SKU . This is the Stock Keeping Unit reference of the item / package. Optionally, enter a Model reference for the package. Optionally, enter the package's Country of Origin Optionally, enter the package's Harmonisation Code . If provided, must be a valid harmonisation code. Note For more information on harmonisation codes, see the UN Trade Statistics site. Optionally, select the package's Shipping Terms Optionally, specify a Unit of packing (e.g. \"box\") Enter a Package Description of up to 100 characters. Optionally, click Add Item to add details of a specific item within the package. The Portal displays additional properties relating to item details. The system uses the same properties to record item details that it does to record package details. Repeat steps 2-12 to record the details of your item. The only mandatory fields for items are Value and Description . Optionally, click Add Another Package to record details of another package. The system displays a new set of properties relating to the new package's details. Repeat steps 2-13 to record the new package's information. To delete an item or package, select the - icon next to the item or package Reference . The shipment must contain details of at least one package. Note As an example, suppose that a clothing retailer has received a customer order for a necklace, a bracelet, and a coat. As the necklace and bracelet are both physically small, the retailer elects to ship them in the same package. The resulting shipment would contain: One package containing details of the coat and its accompanying package. One package containing details of the package that the necklace and bracelet are shipping in. One item containing details of the necklace, nested inside the relevant package. One item containing details of the bracelet, nested inside the relevant package. When the system creates the shipment, it records the package and item details specified in a series of nested contents properties. See the Specifying Shipment Contents section of the PRO v2 API User Guide for an overview of how the PRO Create Shipment API handles shipment contents. When you have configured shipment contents, click Next to display the Origin Details card. Step 4 – Enter Origin The Origin Details card enables you to specify an origin address and contact details for the shipment. This step is mandatory for all shipments. If your organisation (or the selected tenant and channel for multi-tenancy organisations) has shipping locations configured, then the Portal prompts you to select a location as your origin destination. Alternatively, select Enter Address Manually to enter a new address. The Portal displays editable fields relating to address details. If your organisation (or the relevant tenant / channel) does not have shipping locations set up, then the Portal displays the Enter Address Manually fields automatically. The origin address has two mandatory properties, Address Line 1 and Country ISO Code . Postal Code is mandatory for certain countries, but not all. The origin contact has three mandatory properties: First Name Last Name Email In addition, you must provide either a Landline or Mobile contact number for the location. All other fields on the Origin Details card are optional. Note For scheduled shipments, the shipping location is usually prepopulated. Scheduled shipments must use a pre-defined shipping location as either their origin or destination address. For more information on configuring shipping locations, see the Managing Shipping Locations page. Enter the relevant origin address details and click Next to display the Destination Details card. Step 5 – Enter Destination The Destination Details card enables you to specify destination address and contact details for the shipment. This step is mandatory for all shipments. The destination address has two mandatory properties, Address Line 1 and Country ISO Code . Postal Code is mandatory for certain countries, but not all. The destination contact has three mandatory properties: First Name Last Name Email In addition, you must provide either a Landline or Mobile contact number for the location. All other fields on the Destination Details card are optional. Once you have entered the relevant destination details, click Next to move on to the optional Shipping Dates card. Step 6 – Enter Shipping Dates The Shipping Dates card enables you to specify required shipping and delivery dates. This step is optional for all shipments. To specify a specific Shipping Date , or Required Delivery Date select the corresponding Specify Date radio button and select the required date from the date picker. By default, shipping and delivery dates are set to ASAP . Caution The Shipping Date and Required Delivery Date properties limit delivery options for the shipment, meaning that it can only be allocated to those carrier services that would be able to ship it within the specified date range and / or deliver it by the specified required delivery date. If the dates you specify are too restrictive then PRO may be unable to allocate, as there may not be any carrier services available to take the shipment. As such, you should only specify shipping and delivery dates where it is necessary to do so. Once you have specified shipping dates, either click Create Shipment to finish creating the shipment, or Next to display the optional Customs Documentation card. Step 7 – Provide Customs Documentation The Customs Documentation card enables you to specify customs information for international shipments. International shipments require this information in order to ensure successful allocation, customs clearance, and delivery. This step is optional for all shipments. To add customs documentation for a shipment, first select the Yes radio button from the Customs Documentation Required? field. The Portal displays editable fields relating to customs documentation. When providing customs documentation, Shipping Terms and Category Type are mandatory. All other properties are optional. Once you have specified customs information, click Next to display the optional Dangerous Goods card. Step 8 – Provide Dangerous Goods Information The Dangerous Goods card enables you to enter dangerous goods information for the shipment. This step is optional for all shipments. To enter dangerous goods information for a shipment: Select Yes on the Dangerous Goods Required? radio button. The Portal displays a list of packages within the shipment, as dangerous goods information is provided at package level. Click the + button on the required package to display editable fields relating to dangerous goods details. Select an IATA dangerous goods class for the package from the Classes list. Use the radio buttons to select a Packing Group for the package. Enter any ID Number , Proper Shipping Name , and/or Technical Name values for the package as required. Select the package's Physical Form from the drop-down list. Select the package's level of Radioactivity from the drop-down list. Use the radio buttons to specify the package's Accessibility . Enter any Custom Label Text , as required. Note All dangerous goods fields are optional. Once you have finished entering dangerous goods information, click Create Shipment to finish the shipment creation process. The system displays a unique system-generated reference for your new shipment."

This page explains how to configure allocation windows for your carrier services, including specifying bespoke cut-off times for same-day delivery. [!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] Allocation Window Overview Allocation windows enable you to limit the time periods in which PRO can return a quote for a particular carrier service. This can help you to set up \"real-time\" shipping workflows (i.e. a workflow in which shipments are allocated to a carrier service as they are about to leave the warehouse). In PRO, allocation windows are configured as exclusions (that is, you configure days and times during which PRO cannot return quotes for a particular carrier service, with the system able to return quotes for that service at all other times). Allocation window exclusions are comprised of the following information: One or more associated carrier services. One or more associated shipping locations. For organisations using multi-tenancy, a selected scope (i.e. a list of your organisation's tenants and channels to which the window exclusion applies). Start and end times for the window exclusion. Once the window is configured, PRO can only return the selected carrier services in quotes requested from the selected shipping locations by the selected tenants and channels outside the times specified. You can configured multiple window exclusions for each carrier service if required. Note Allocation windows define whether or not a particular carrier service is available for consideration when generating quotes. They do not define the availability of the carrier service to take the shipment in question. Even if a service is \"available\" outside an allocation window exclusion, that is not a guarantee that the service will be able to actually quote. Allocation Window Worked Example The following example shows window exclusions set up for three carrier services: Carrier Service Scope(s) Window Start Window End HMSUK Location: SLOC001 , Tenant: * , Channel: * 00:00:00 (UTC) 03:29:59 (UTC) HMSBFPO Location: * , Tenant: TEN_01 , Channel: * 00:00:00 (UTC) 03:29:59 (UTC) DPD_ND Location: * , Tenant: TEN_01 , Channel: * 00:00:00 (UTC) 13:59:59 (UTC) DPD_ND Location: * , Tenant: TEN_01 , Channel: * 19:00:01 (UTC) 23:59:59 (UTC) DPD_ND Location: * , Tenant: * , Channel: * 03:30:01 (UTC) 23:59:59 (UTC) With this configuration: Service HMSUK can only be returned in quotes from shipping location SLOC001 between 03:30:00 and 23:59:59. Service HMSBFPO can only be returned in quotes requested by tenant TEN_01 between 03:30:00 and 23:59:59. Service DPD_ND can only be returned in quotes requested by tenant TEN_01 between 14:00:00 and 19:00:00. Service DPD_ND can only be returned in quotes requested by tenants other than TEN_01 between 00:00:00 and 03:30:00. Creating Allocation Window Exclusions To create an allocation window exclusion: From the side menu, select Settings > Allocation Windows > Allocation Window Exclusions to display the Allocation Window Exclusions page. Click the Create Allocation Window Exclusion button to display the Shipping Location tile. Select the shipping locations to which the allocation window exclusion should apply and then click Next to display the Tenants and Channels tile. Select the scope for the allocation window exclusion: To select all available tenants and channels, click the Select All check box at the top of the list. To select a particular tenant and all of its channels, click that tenant's Select All check box. To select a particular channel within a tenant, click the tenant's + icon and then select the channel from the list. Click Next to display the Carrier Services tile. Select the carrier services to which the allocation window exception should apply and then click Next to display the Exclusion Details tab. Configure the days and times that the exclusion applies to. Select the Exclusion Days of the week to which the exclusion applies. Enter the start time of the exclusion into the Window Start field, and the end time into the Window End field. Enter a brief Description of the exclusion window. Note Allocation exclusion windows repeat weekly based on the days and times selected. Click Create Allocation Exclusion to finish creating the window. The system no longer returns the selected services in quotes from the selected tenants, channels, and/or locations within the specified timeframe. Note You can configure multiple windows for services, tenants/channels, and locations if required. For example, if you wanted to exclude a particular service between 09:00:00 and 10:00:00 in the morning, and then again between 21:00:00 and 22:00:00 at night, you could set up two separate windows with the same service, tenant/channel, and location details. Editing Existing Allocation Window Exclusions To edit an existing allocation window exclusion, select Settings > Allocation Windows > Allocation Window Exclusions to display the Allocation Window Exclusions page and then click Edit on the window that you want to edit. The process of editing an existing window exclusion is the same as that used to set up a new window exclusion. To delete an existing allocation window exclusion, select Settings > Allocation Windows > Allocation Window Exclusions to display the Allocation Window Exclusions page and then click Delete on the window that you want to delete. Select Delect Exclusion on the confirmation dialog to confirm the deletion. Post-Midnight Allocation Overview Post-midnight allocation enables a next-day service to operate as a same-day service for a specified period of time. Ordinarily, a next-day service would have an allocation cutoff of 23:59:59 on any given day. Once that time has passed then a new day has started, and any shipments allocated would be scheduled for the day after. For example, Shipment 1 allocating to next-day service Example1 at 23:59:00 on a Monday would be delivered on the Tuesday, while Shipment 2 allocating to the same service five minutes later (i.e. 00:04:00 on the Tuesday) would be scheduled for delivery on the Wednesday. Post-midnight allocation enables you to push this cut-off time back. Continuing from the previous example, if you were to specify a post-midnight allocation time of 01:30 for the Example1 carrier service, then both shipments would be delivered on the Tuesday, even though Shipment 2 was technically not created until that same day. From a configuration standpoint, as a next day service Example1 would ordinarily have a transit time of one day. By creating a post-midnight allocation window, you effectively change the transit time of the service to zero days when allocating between 00:00 and 01:30 in the morning. Configuring Post-Midnight Allocation Windows To create a post-midnight allocation window: From the side menu, select Settings > Allocation Windows > Post-Midnight Allocations to display the Post-Midnight Allocation Windows page. Click Create New Allocation Window to display the Shipping Location tile. Select the shipping locations to which the post-midnight allocation window should apply and then click Next to display the Tenants and Channels tile. Select the scope for the post-midnight allocation window: To select all available tenants and channels, click the Select All check box at the top of the list. To select a particular tenant and all of its channels, click that tenant's Select All check box. To select a particular channel within a tenant, click the tenant's + icon and then select the channel from the list. Click Next to display the Carrier Services tile. Select the carrier services to which the post-midnight allocation window should apply and then click Next to display the Exclusion Details tab. Select the Allocation Cut-Off time that you want to apply to the selected combination of services, tenants/channels, and locations, and then click Create Allocation Exclusion to create the allocation window. Deleting Existing Post-Midnight Allocation Windows To delete an existing post-midnight allocation window, select Settings > Allocation Windows > Post-Midnight Allocation Windows to display the Post-Midnight Allocation Windows page and click Delete on the window that you want to delete. Select Delete Window on the confirmation dialog to confirm the deletion."

To view the page, select Settings > Carriers > Carrier Services from the main menu. Each tile has an Active / Inactive toggle, enabling you to view the status of each carrier. PRO does not allocate shipments to carrier services from inactive carriers. From this page, you can: Click a tile's View button to display the Carrier Service page for that carrier. Click the Test Rates button to view rates for a dummy shipment. Note The information provided on the Carrier Service Management page is read-only. The process of configuring new carriers is handled by Sorted. Viewing Carrier Services The Carrier Services page displays details of all of the enabled carrier services for a particular carrier. Note The information provided on the Carrier Services page is read-only. The process of configuring new carrier services is handled by Sorted. The page includes the following information for each carrier service: Service Reference – A unique reference for the carrier service. Carrier Service – The carrier's description of the carrier service. Service Type – Indicates whether the service is Scheduled or On Demand . Action - Contains the Edit Scope button. This button opens the Multi-tenancy page, from where you can assign a carrier service to a particular combination of tenants and channels if required. Note For more information on configuring tenants and channels, see the Managing Tenants and Channels page. To filter the list of services by either Service Reference or Service Type , use the search bar at the top of the page. Testing Example Rates The Test Rates feature enables you to get delivery quotes based on details of a yet-to-be-created shipment. To do so, click the Test Rates button to display the Test Rates page and then use the wizard to enter the shipment details that you want to get quotes for. The Test Rates wizard is identical to the Create New Shipment wizard. Note For more information on creating new shipments in the Sorted Portal, see the Creating New Shipments page. Once you have filled in your shipment details and clicked the View Rates button, the system displays the Test Rates Results page. Note The shipment details entered are only used to generate delivery quotes via PRO's quotes engine. The system does not create any shipments while testing rates. The Test Rates Results page displays a list of quote results. Each quote represents an offer for carriage of a shipment with a specific carrier service, and displays carrier service, date, and price information. From the Test Rates Results page, you can: Run a New Test with entirely new shipment information. Use Edit Test to amend the shipment details you added and generate new quotes. Use View Carriers to view relevant carrier info. Managing Carrier Service Groups Carrier service groups are user-defined pools of carrier services. They are designed to be used during the allocation process as a means of limiting the carrier services that a particular shipment could be allocated to. For example, you might set up a group containing all services that will ship dangerous goods. You would then allocate within that group for all shipments involving dangerous items. Note For more information on allocating using carrier service groups in the Sorted Portal, see the Managing Existing Shipments page. You can manage your carrier service groups from the Settings > Carriers > Carrier Service Groups page. The Carrier Service Groups page displays a tile for each of your groups, including a unique Code and list of Included Services for that group. Click Edit to change the services included in the group, or Remove to delete the group entirely. Warning Removed groups cannot be reactivated. You would need to re-create the group in order to reactivate a removed group. Creating New Carrier Service Groups To create a new carrier service group: Select the Create New Carrier Service Group tile. The system displays editable fields relating to carrier service group details. Enter a Carrier Service Group Name and Carrier Service Group Code for your group. Use the check boxes to select the carrier services that you want to add to the group. To select all available carrier services, click the check box at the top of the list. Click Save to save your changes and create the group."

[!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] Accessing the Shipments Dashboard You can view your existing shipments via the Shipments dashboard. To access the Shipments dashboard, select PRO > View Shipments from the main menu. Filtering Shipment Data Initially, the dashboard displays four tiles, enabling you to filter your shipments by exception status. Selecting a tile displays a dashboard showing the number of shipments in that exception status, broken down into shipment state. The available tiles are: All Shipments - enables you to view all of your current shipments. Critical Exception - enables you to view information on only those shipments that are in a \"red\" or critical state (such as Missing or Damaged ). Shipments in a critical state generally require further action to ensure successful delivery of the shipment. Other Exceptions - enables you to view information on only those shipments that are in a \"amber\" shipment state (such as Delayed or Delivery Failed ). Amber shipment states are generally for notification only, but may require further action later. All Good - enables you to view information on only those shipments that are in a \"green\" shipment state (such as Manifested or In Transit ). Green shipment states are states that are expected throughout the successful delivery lifecycle of a shipment. These states generally do not require intervention and are for informational and auditing purposes only. You can navigate between exception states using the drop down menu below the page header. Each exception status dashboard has tabs at the top enabling you to further filter the information displayed: All Shipments - displays information on all shipments that are in states with the selected exception status. Scheduled – displays information on only those shipments that are intended to be allocated to a scheduled service (that is, the pickup location has a regularly planned collection). On-Demand – displays information on only those shipments that are intended to be allocated to an on-demand service (that is, the pickup location does not have a regular, scheduled collection from a pre-defined location). Select a shipment state tile to view the Shipment Summary page for that state. Viewing a List of Shipments The Shipment Summary page displays a list of all the individual shipments within a particular shipment state. You can view the Shipment Summary page either by navigating through the Shipments dashboard or by using the Search By bar at the top of the page. The Search By bar enables you to search for shipments by Shipment Reference , Custom Reference , Postcode , or Tracking Reference , and displays a list of only the shipments that meet the specified criteria. The Shipment Summary page includes the following information for each shipment: Reference – The auto generated unique reference. Custom Reference – As provided by the customer. Date Created Required Shipping Date – Requested date of collection from the origin location. Required Delivery Date – Requested date of delivery to the destination. Destination Carrier Service – The allocated Carrier Service Actual Delivery Date Select a shipment to display the View Shipment page. Viewing Individual Shipments The View Shipment page displays all information relating to a particular shipment. The View Shipment page includes the following sections: Actions – enables you to perform shipment actions (e.g. Allocate / Cancel / Manifest). Address – the collection and delivery points for the shipment. Shipment Details – references and required shipping/delivery dates for the shipment. Carrier Details – information relating to the current allocated carrier. Contents Tab – information relating to the contents of the shipment, such as line items, cost, value, dimensions etc. Tracking Tab – available tracking information for the shipment. Documents Tab – lists all labels and applicable documentation, such as customs documentation or Commercial Invoices. All listed items can be printed. This tab is not displayed if there are no documents available. Metadata Tab – displays any metadata applied to the shipment. Performing Shipment Actions The Actions panel of the View Shipment page is displayed at the top of the screen. This panel contains various buttons that you can use to progress the shipment into a further state. The actions available to a shipment changes depending on the state that that shipment is in. This section explains the shipment actions available and the circumstances in which they can be used: Allocating with Default Rules Allocate with Default Rules allocates the shipment to the best available carrier service. PRO uses the following process to determine the service used: Filter Carrier Services - PRO determines which carriers have services available that can be used for the requested shipment. Perform Parameter Validation - PRO takes allocation rules and carrier specifics (such as packaging sizes, zones, and delivery time windows) into account, removing any services that do not meet these criteria. Order by Value - If two or more services remain, then PRO provides the cheapest option as the option of choice. Once allocated, the shipment progresses to the Allocated state. If the shipment cannot be allocated, then it progresses to the Allocation Failed state. Note For more information on configuring allocation rules, see the Managing Shipping Rules page. Allocating with Service Group Allocate with Service Group allocates the shipment using a user-defined pool of carrier services. PRO allocates within this pool via the same process as Allocate with Default Rules . Once allocated, the shipment progresses to the Allocated state. If the shipment cannot be allocated, then it progresses to the Allocation Failed state. Note For more information on configuring service groups, see the Managing Carrier Service Groups section of the Managing Carrier Services page. Manifesting a Shipment In the context of PRO, the term \"manifesting\" refers to collating, formatting and transmitting shipment data to carriers. It is the final step of many Sorted workflows. Once manifested, the shipment progresses to the Manifested state. If the shipment cannot be manifested, then it progresses to the Manifest Failed state. Cancelling a Shipment Once a shipment has been cancelled, no further actions can be performed on it. Note You can only cancel shipments that are in one of the following states: Unallocated Allocated Allocation Failed Manifest Failed"

[!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] Viewing Your Shipping Locations You can view shipping locations from the Settings > Shipping Locations page. The Shipping Locations page displays a list of all current shipping locations, including the following information: Location Reference - The location's unique reference. Name - The shipping location name. Address - The geographical address of the shipping location. Status - The current status of the shipping location (either Active or Inactive ). You can only use active shipping locations as an originating address when creating shipments. Actions - Available actions related to the shipping location. Note Shipping Locations are typically added during the customer onboarding process, and are rarely added or edited once that process is complete. However, the collection calendars belonging to those shipping locations may require more frequent updates. Managing Collection Calendars Collection Calendars define cut-off times for a shipping location. For example, a collection calendar could be used to specify an allocation cut-off time of 4pm for a particular carrier at a particular location. Any shipments allocated to that carrier after that time would be collected the following day. Collection calendars are defined for each carrier at each shipping location. Note In addition to your regular calendar collections, you can also configure custom allocation window exclusions and post-midnight cutoff times at a shipping location, carrier, or tenant/channel level. For more information on configuring allocation exceptions, see the Managing Allocation Windows page.

[!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] What Is a Shipping Mode? [!include[_what_is_a_shipping_mode](../pro/api/includes/_what_is_a_shipping_mode.md)] Managing Existing Shipping Modes You can view your existing shipping modes from the Settings > Shipping > Shipping Modes page. The Shipping Modes page displays the following information for each mode: Name Description Valid From / To - These are optional validity dates for the entire shipping mode and should not be confused with allocation windows (that is, the timeframe in which an allocation limit applies). Actions - Edit - Click Edit to edit the mode. The process of editing an existing mode is largely the same as that used to set up a new mode, as explained in the Adding a New Shipping Mode section. Note that you cannot amend the Name of an existing shipping mode. Actions - Delete - Click Delete to remove the mode from the list entirely. Adding a New Shipping Mode To add a new shipping mode, select the Settings > Shipping > Shipping Modes page and click Add New Shipping Mode . The Portal displays the Add Shipping Mode Details card of the Add New Shipping Mode page. Step 1: Adding Shipping Mode Details The Add Shipping Mode Details card enables you to enter identifying information about your new mode: To add shipping mode details: Optionally, enter Valid From and Valid To dates. The mode only applies during the specified time period. Enter a unique Name of between five and 100 characters for the mode. Optionally, enter a Description of up to 150 characters for the mode. Click Next to display the Set Allocation Windows card. Step 2: Setting Allocation Windows The Set Allocation Windows card enables you to define the volume limits and start times for the allocation windows within the shipping mode. Each allocation window is 24 hours long, and you can configure up to seven windows in each mode (that is, separate allocation limits for each day of the week). To configure allocation windows: Select a start time for your allocation windows from the Choose Start Time drop-down menu. This time is used as the start time for all windows within the mode. Select a time zone for your start time from the Choose Time Zone drop-down menu. For each allocation window that you want to set an allocation limit for: Enter a Volume Limit . This is the maximum number of shipments that should be allocated to the mode's carrier services during the specified timeframe. Select an Allocation Type . This value defines what happens when a service reaches its limit for that allocation window. There are two options: Soft - The carrier service can still be allocated to if that carrier is the only carrier that is able to take the shipment. Hard - The carrier is no longer available for allocation and is excluded from all selections until the end of the daily allocation window. For example, you might specify the following allocation windows: Period Volume limit Type Mon @ 03:00 (UTC) - Tues @ 02:59 (UTC) 10,000 hard Tues @ 03:00 (UTC) - Tues @ 02:59 (UTC) 15,000 soft Wed @ 03:00 (UTC) - Tues @ 02:59 (UTC) 20,000 soft Thurs @ 03:00 (UTC) - Fri @ 02:59 (UTC) 30,000 hard Fri @ 03:00 (UTC) - Sat @ 02:59 (UTC) 20,000 soft Sat @ 03:00 (UTC) - Sun @ 02:59 (UTC) null - Sun @ 03:00 (UTC) - Mon @ 02:59 (UTC) null - These rules can be expressed as: For 24 hours from every Monday at 03:00 (UTC) the selected carrier services have a hard limit of 10,000 allocations For 24 hours from every Tuesday at 03:00 (UTC) the selected carrier services have a soft limit of 15,000 allocations For 24 hours from every Wednesday at 03:00 (UTC) the selected carrier services have a soft limit of 20,000 allocations For 24 hours from every Thursday at 03:00 (UTC) the selected carrier services have a hard limit of 30,000 allocations For 24 hours from every Friday at 03:00 (UTC) the selected carrier services have a soft limit of 20,000 allocations For 48 hours from every Saturday at 03:00 (UTC) the selected carrier services have no limit (i.e. \"infinite\" allocations) These windows would then repeat every Monday at 3:00 for the duration of the shipping mode (as defined in the Valid To date from step 1). Once you have configured your shipping windows, click Next to display the Choose Carrier Services card. Step 3: Selecting Carrier Services The Choose Carrier Services card enables you to select the carrier services that your shipping mode applies to. Select the carrier services that you want the limits specified in step 2 to apply to. To search for a specific carrier service, type a name into the search bar. Once you have selected the required carrier services, click Next to display the Choose Shipping Locations card. Step 4: Selecting Shipping Locations The Choose Shipping Locations card enables you to select the shipping locations that your shipping mode applies to. You can either include shipping locations (i.e. \"the mode applies to all shipments originating from these shipping locations\") or exclude shipping locations (i.e. \"the mode applies to all shipments except those originating from these shipping locations\"). To link shipping locations to your mode, use the radio buttons to select whether you want to Include shipping locations or Exclude shipping locations and then select the shipping locations you want to link from the list. To search for a specific carrier service, type a name into the search bar. Once you have finished selecting shipping locations, click Add Shipping Mode to save your changes and close the Add Shipping Mode page."

Viewing Existing Shipping Rules To view your existing shipping rules, select the Settings > Shipping > Shipping Rules page. The Shipping Rules page displays the following information about each rule: Name Description Valid From / To - Shipping rules have set start and end dates, defined during the configuration process Enabled - Use the toggle to enable or disable existing shipping rules. PRO does not take disabled shipping rules into account. To edit an existing rule, click Edit . The process of editing an existing rule is the same as that used to set up a new rule, as explained in the Adding New Shipping Rules section. To export details of the rule as a JSON object, click Export . Adding New Shipping Rules To add a new shipping rule, select the Settings > Shipping > Shipping Rules page and click Add New Shipping Rule . The Portal displays the Add New Shipping Rule page. Step 1: Adding Shipping Rule Details The Add Shipping Rule Details card enables you to enter identifying information about your new rule: To add shipping rule details: Optionally, enter Valid From and Valid To dates. The rule only applies during the specified time period. Enter a unique Name of between five and 100 characters for the rule. Optionally, enter a Description of up to 150 characters for the rule. Click Next to display the Set Countries, Regions and Postcodes card. Step 2: Setting Countries, Regions and Postcodes The Set Countries, Regions and Postcodes card enables you to set geographic restrictions that may apply to the rule. For example, you might specify that the rule applies only to those shipments destined for the UK, or that the rule applies to all shipments except those bound for the USA. To explicitly include or exclude countries from the shipping rule: Select the Country that the rule applies to. The country is added to the My Selected Countries list. Use the Include countries and Exclude countries radio buttons to select whether the countries in the list should be included or excluded from the rule. Note You cannot specify both include and exclude destination criteria in the same rule. Regional Rules For certain countries, the system enables you to create rules at a regional or postcode level. For example, you might specify that the rule applies only to those shipments destined for an M2 postcode, or that the rule applies to all shipments except those destined for the state of Florida, USA. Currently, Sorted supports regional rules for the following countries: United States (states) United Kingdom (counties) Australia (states) Canada (provinces) Ireland (counties) To configure regional rules: Select the relevant country from the Country list and ensure that the Include regions and postcodes radio button is selected. Select the Set regions and/or postcodes check box. The Portal displays additional fields relating to region selection. Use the radio buttons to select whether you want to Include regions and postcodes or Exclude regions and postcodes. Select an entire region to include or exclude from the rule (e.g. a US state or British county) by selecting that region from the Regions drop-down menu. Enter a postcode into the Postcodes field to add that postcode to the rule. Note For UK shipments, you can enter either a whole postcode (e.g. M2 6LW) or a postcode area (e.g. M2) into the Postcodes field. If you enter a postcode area then the Portal selects all shipments in that area. To add additional regions or postcodes, select Add New Region or Add New Postcode . To remove a region or postcode, click its trash icon. Alternatively, select Remove all regions or Remove all postcodes . Once you have finished setting up geographic restrictions, click Next to display the Set Values, Weight, and Dimensions card. Step 3: Setting Values, Weight and Dimensions The Set Values, Weight, and Dimensions card enables you to specify minimum and maximum values, weights and dimensions for the rule. All values on this card are optional and \"open-ended\". That is, you can specify a minimum value or weight without specifying a maximum, or vice versa. To configure values, weights and dimensions: Enter a minimum and / or maximum Shipment Value as a numerical value, and select the relevant Currency . Note You can add up to five shipment value ranges. To add a new value range, click Add new value . To remove a value range, click the trash icon. Enter a minimum and / or maximum Shipment Dead Weight as a numerical value, and use the radio buttons to select whether the value is in kg or lbs . Enter a minimum and / or maximum Package Volumetric Weight as a numerical value. The Package Volumetric Weight uses the weight units selected in the Shipment Dead Weight field. Enter a minimum and / or maximum Package Length as a numerical value, and use the radio buttons to select whether the value is in cm or in . Enter a minimum and / or maximum Package Girth as a numerical value. The Package Girth uses the dimension units selected in the Package Length field. When you have configured values, weights, and dimensions, click Next to display the Link Tenants and Channels card card. Step 4: Linking Tenants and Channels The Link Tenants and Channels card enables you to select the tenants and channels that your rule applies to, where applicable. You can link tenants and channels to your rule in the following ways: To link your new rule to a tenant and all of its associated channels, select that tenant from the list. To link your new rule to selected channels within a tenant, click the + icon by the tenant's name to display all of that tenant's channels, and then select the channel or channels you require. To search for a specific tenant or channel, type a name into the search bar. To select all tenants and channels that you have available, click Select all tenants and channels . Note For more information on configuring tenants and channels within the Sorted platform, see the Managing Tenants and Channels page. If a rule has tenants and channels selected then it only applies to shipments created as part of that tenant or channel. Likewise, if you do not select any tenants of channels on this card then your rule applies to all of your tenants and channels. <!--is that right?--> Once you have selected the tenants and channels you require, click Next to display the Link Carrier Services card. Step 5: Linking Carrier Services The Link Carrier Services card enables you to select the carrier services that your shipping rule applies to. Select the carrier services that you want the new rule to apply to. To search for a specific carrier service, type a name into the search bar. Once you have selected the required carrier services, click Next to display the Link Shipping Locations card. Step 6: Linking Shipping Locations The Link Shipping Locations card enables you to select the shipping locations that your shipping rule applies to. You can either include shipping locations (i.e. \"the rule applies to all shipments originating from these shipping locations\") or exclude shipping locations (i.e. \"the rule applies to all shipments except those originating from these shipping locations\"). You can link shipping locations to your rule in the following ways: To link a specific location or locations to your rule, use the radio buttons to select whether you want to Include shipping locations or Exclude shipping locations and then select the shipping locations you want to link from the list. To search for a specific carrier service, type a name into the search bar. To select all available shipping locations, click Select All . Once you have finished linking shipping locations, click Add Shipping Rule to save your changes and close the Add Shipping Rule page. Worked Examples This section gives worked examples for how combinations of rules can affect the carrier services that are eligible to take a shipment. In these examples we have four carrier services: A , B , C , and D . Each of these carrier services has its own linked ruleset that defines whether or not it is eligible to take the shipments in that example. Scenario 1 - Geographic Rulesets In this scenario, we have the following rules defined: Carrier Service Geographic Rules Value Rules Weight/Dimension Rules A Include: Country US , postal code =~ 322xx - - B Include: Country US - - C - - - D Exclude: Country US , Postal Code =~ 809xx - - We have the following shipment: Destination Value Weight US, 32202 20GBP 1.2kg The results of processing the shipping rules are as follows: Carrier Service Included Reason A ✔️ Geographic rule matches country and postcode B ✔️ Geographic rule matches country C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ✔️ Not excluded by geographic rules However, given the following shipment the results differ: Destination Value Weight US, 80922 20GBP 1.2kg Results: Carrier Service Included Reason A ❌ Geographic rule postcode mismatch - service is not included B ✔️ Geographic rule matches country C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ❌ Excluded by geographic rules Scenario 2 - Value Rulesets In this scenario, we have the following rules defined: Carrier Service Geographic Rules Value Rules Weight/Dimension Rules A - Include: > 10GBP - B - Include: >= 10GBP , < 50GBP - C - - - D - Exclude: > 15GBP - We have the following shipment: Destination Value Weight US, 32202 20GBP 1.2kg The results of processing the shipping rules are as follows: Carrier Service Included Reason A ✔️ Value rule includes this service B ✔️ Value rule includes this service C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ❌ Excluded by value rule However, given the following shipment the results differ: Destination Value Weight US, 32202 8.55GBP 1.2kg Results: Carrier Service Included Reason A ❌ Value rule not matched - service is not included B ❌ Value rule not matched - service is not included C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ✔️ Not excluded by value rule Scenario 3 - Weights and Dimensions Rulesets In this scenario, we have the following rules defined: Carrier Service Geographic Rules Value Rules Weight/Dimension Rules A - - Include: < 10kg B - - Include: > 1kg , <= 15kg C - - - D - - Exclude: > 8.5kg We have the following shipment: Destination Value Weight US, 32202 20GBP 9.0kg The results of processing the shipping rules are as follows: Carrier Service Included Reason A ✔️ Weight rule includes this service B ✔️ Weight rule includes this service C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ❌ Excluded by weight rule However, given the following shipment the results differ: Destination Value Weight US, 32202 8.55GBP 5.25kg Results: Carrier Service Included Reason A ✔️ Weight rule includes this service B ✔️ Weight rule includes this service C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ✔️ Not excluded by weight rule Scenario 4 - Mixed Rulesets This scenario is more complex and involves multiple types of rules: Carrier Service Geographic Rules Value Rules Weight/Dimension Rules A Include: Country DE - Include: < 10kg B - Include: > 10GBP , <= 20GBP Include: > 1kg , <= 15kg C - - - D Exclude: Country DE , Postal Code =~ 554xx - Exclude: > 8.5kg We have the following shipment: Destination Value Weight DE, 55482 9.65GBP 5.45kg The results of processing the shipping rules are as follows: Carrier Service Included Reason A ✔️ Matches both geographic include rule and weight include rule B ❌ Does not match value rule; matches weight rule C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ❌ Excluded by geographic rule. Not excluded by weight rule. However, given the following shipment the results differ: Destination Value Weight DE, 20054 19.25GBP 9.5kg Results: Carrier Service Included Reason A ✔️ Matches both geographic and weight/dimension rule includes B ✔️ Matches both value and weight/dimension rule includes C ✔️ Not excluded by any rules D ❌ Not excluded by geographic rule. Excluded by weight/dimension rule"

This page explains how to use the Multi-tenancy page to set up and manage tenants and channels. [!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] Multi-Tenancy Overview Within the Sorted platform, a tenant is a sub-company that exists within a customer account. Tenants can be further divided into channels , which are analogous to brands or smaller companies. Tenants and channels can have their own carrier services, carrier accounts, shipping locations, and users, enabling the platform to support complex retail operations in which each of a customer's brands operates as essentially a separate entity. For example, suppose that a clothing company group called ABC Limited becomes a Sorted customer. ABC Limited consists of three separate companies: Aunty Mabel Co – a clothing brand selling high value items to a more mature audience. Billy Bob's Apparel – a clothing brand selling work wear. City Stocks – a clothing brand with two “child brands”. City Bespoke Clothing. City Hats and Shoes. In this example, ABC Limited would create tenants for each of their three sub-companies from their parent account. Within the City Stocks tenant, they would also create two channels. Channels are added as part of the tenant creation process. You can manage your tenants and channels in the Sorted Portal via the Managing Tenants page. To access the Managing Tenants page, select Settings > Multi-tenancy from the main menu. Viewing Tenants To view your tenants, select the Managing Tenants page, and ensure that the Tenants tab is selected. The Managing Tenants page displays a tile for each of your tenants. From here, you can use the Active / Inactive toggle to deactivate and reactivate tenants as required, or select Edit to edit the tenant's details. The process of editing an existing tenant is the same as that used to set up a new tenant, as explained in the Adding a New Tenant section of this page. Viewing Channels To view your channels, select the Managing Tenants page, and click the Channels tab. The Channels tab displays a table of your existing channels, including their associated Tenant Name and the number of Users , Carrier Services , Carrier Account Configurations , and Shipping Locations that that channel has. From here, you can use the Enable / Disable toggle to deactivate and reactivate channels as required, or select Edit to edit the channel details. The process of editing an existing channel is the same as that used to set up a new channel, as explained in the Adding a New Channel section of this page. Adding a New Tenant To add a new tenant, select the Managing Tenants page and click the Add New Tenant card from the Tenants tab. The system displays the Add New Tenant page. Step 1: Adding Tenant Details The Tenant Details card enables you to enter identifying information about your new tenant Add a Name . This is a unique identifier for the tenant, and must be between three and 50 characters long. Optionally, add a tenant Description of up to 100 characters. Click Next to display the Add Channels card Step 2 (Optional): Adding Channels The Add Channels card enables you to add channels to your new tenant. If you do not want to add channels to your tenant, click Next to display the Link Users card. To add a channel: Add a Name . This is a unique identifier for the channel, and must be between three and 50 characters long. Optionally, add a channel Description of up to 100 characters. Click Add to Channel List to add the channel to the tenant's Channel List Once you have entered the channels you need, click Next to display the Link Users card. Step 3: Linking Users The Link Users card enables you to to link users to your tenant and its channels. Users cannot access a tenant or channel unless they have been linked to it. For example, a customer working with a system integration may create a \"system\" user and restrict that user so that they can only create shipments for a specific tenant. To link users: Select a user or users from the Select users menu. Select the tenant and channels that you want to link those users to from the Link selected users to menu. Click Add to my selection to link the selected users to the selected tenant and channels. The system adds your selection to the My selection list. In the example image above, Default Users 1 and 3 have been granted access to the sorted_brand_02 channel within the sorted_group tenant. Note For more information on configuring users, see the Managing Users and Roles page. Once you have finished linking your users, click Next to display the Link Carrier Services card. Step 4: Linking Carrier Services The Link Carrier Services card enables you to to link carrier services to your tenant and its channels. To link carrier services: Select one or more carrier services from the Select carrier services menu. Select the tenant and channels that you want to link those services to from the Link selected carrier services to menu. Click Add to my selection to link the selected services to the selected tenant and channels. The system adds your selection to the My selection list. In the example image above, Carrier Services 2 and 6 have been granted access to the sorted_brand_02 channel within the sorted_group tenant. Note For more information on managing carrier services, see the Managing Carrier Services page. Once you have finished linking your carrier services, click Next to display the Link Carrier Account Configuration card. Step 5: Link Carrier Account Configurations <!--Need more info on carrier account configurations, what are they, how do we set them up etc?--> The Link Carrier Account Configuration card enables you to to link carrier account configurations to your tenant and its channels. To link carrier account configurations: Select one or more account configurations from the Select carrier account configuration menu. Select the tenant and channels that you want to link those account configurations to from the Link selected carrier account configurations to menu. Click Add to my selection to link the selected account configurations to the selected tenant and channels. The system adds your selection to the My selection list. In the example image above, Carrier Account Configurations 2 and 6 have been granted access to the sorted_brand_02 channel within the sorted_group tenant. Once you have finished linking your account configurations, click Next to display the Link Shipping Locations card. Step 6: Link Shipping Locations The Link Shipping Location card enables you to to link shipping locations to your tenant and its channels. To link shipping locations: Select one or more shipping locations from the Select shipping locations menu. Select the tenant and channels that you want to link those shipping locations to from the Link selected shipping locations to menu. Click Add to my selection to link the selected shipping locations to the selected tenant and channels. The system adds your selection to the My selection list. In the example image above, Sorted Group Location has been granted access to the sorted_brand_02 channel within the sorted_group tenant. Note For more information on configuring shipping locations, see the Managing Shipping Locations page. Finally, select Add Tenant to create your tenant and close the Add New Tenant page. Adding a New Channel As well as creating new channels during the tenant creation process, you can also create new channels directly by clicking Add new channels on the Channels tab of the Managing Tenants page. The process of creating a new channel is largely the same as the process of creating a new tenant, with one exception: instead of a Tenant Details card the Add New Channels page displays a Choose Tenant card from which you can select the tenant that you want your new channel to be associated with. Select the tenant and click Next to display the Add Channels card. The rest of the process is the same as that detailed in the Adding a New Tenant section."

[!include[_development_statement](../pro/api/includes/_development_statement.md)] What is a Shipment Group? In SortedPRO, a shipment group is a collection of one or more shipments, all of which must be allocated with the same carrier service. PRO enables you to manifest all shipments in a group simultaneously, as well as getting a collection note for the entire shipment group. Shipment groups enable you to align your manifest processes with your operational flows. For example, suppose that you allocate 500 shipments to a particular carrier and your distribution centre places those shipments into a cage to be loaded onto the carrier's outbound trailer. By creating a shipment group corresponding to that carrier's cage and then adding the relevant shipments to it, you could manifest all the shipments that the carrier will take on that trailer in a single API call. Shipment groups are creating and managed using the PRO Shipment Groups API. Note For information on managing shipment groups via API, see the Managing Shipment Groups section of the PRO v2 API User Guide. Viewing Shipment Groups To access the Shipment Groups page, select PRO > Shipment Groups from the main menu. The Shipment Groups page displays a list of all your current shipment groups, including their Group Reference , Custom Reference , Version , and the Shipment Count for the group. To search for a specific group by its custom reference, enter the relevant reference into the Search by Custom Reference bar. You can toggle between viewing All Versions of the groups and only the Latest Versions using the buttons at the top of the page. Versioning in Shipment Groups [!include[_shipments_group_versioning](../pro/api/includes/_shipments_group_versioning.md)] Shipment Group Actions The Shipment Groups page enables you to perform the following actions for each of your shipment groups: Lock and unlock groups using the State toggle. Shipments cannot be added to or removed from a locked shipment group. View a Collection Note . Collection notes are PDF documents that resemble a driver's manifest. You can only get a collection note for a locked shipment group. Use the Close Group button to close the group. Once a shipment group has been closed, it cannot be reopened. You can only close a shipment group once it has been locked."

This page explains the shipment properties that REACT can calculate, how calculated events work, and how best to use calculated events What is a Calculated Event? A calculated event is an event that is generated by REACT's internal processing, rather than as a result of an external tracking update. Each shipment has two properties that REACT can change without receiving a carrier tracking update. They are: may_be_missing - Indicates whether REACT believes that the shipment may be missing. REACT marks shipments as may_be_missing if they are not updated within a set time period after registration, or if they are not marked as delivered, lost, or refused within a different set time period. lateness . Contains two sub-properties - lateness.is_late and lateness.hours_late . These properties indicate whether REACT believes a shipment to be late, and (where applicable) how many hours late this shipment is. When REACT updates one of these properties, it creates a calculated event to record the change. You can retrieve calculated events in the same way you would retrieve regular, carrier-derived events. Note For more information on retrieving events, see the Retrieving Shipment and Event Data page of the docs portal, and the Get Shipment Events section of the API reference. May Be Missing If REACT believes that a shipment may be lost, it sets that shipment's may_be_missing property to true . By default, the may_be_missing property is set to false . Caution may_be_missing is always set based on REACT's internal calculations. A may_be_missing value of true does not mean that the carrier has notified Sorted that the shipment may be missing. REACT sets a shipment's may_be_missing property to true if either of the following conditions are met: Condition 1 No state changing tracking event has been received for that shipment within 12 hours of the shipment being registered with REACT (as recorded in the created_on property) OR within 12 hours of the shipped_date (whichever is earlier). Note that shipped_date is an optional field. Condition 2 All of the following conditions are met: The shipment has never been in any of the final states . The shipment has a country ISO code registered for both its origin and destination addresses (via the addresses.country_iso_code property). It has been more than 24 hours since a tracking event was received for a domestic shipment, OR more than 72 hours since a tracking event was received for an international shipment. Shipments are classed as domestic if their origin and destination addresses.country_iso_code is identical. Otherwise, they are classified as international. Late The lateness.is_late property denotes whether REACT believes a shipment to be late. By default, the is_late property is set to false . REACT sets is_late to true if all of the following conditions are met: The shipment has a promised_date recorded. The date and time recorded in promised_date has elapsed. The shipment did not enter any of the final states before the promised_date elapsed. If a shipment does not have a promised_date recorded, then REACT cannot perform lateness calculations for that shipment. If a shipment is marked as late, then REACT records how many hours late it is in the lateness.hours_late property. This information is refreshed every time the shipment is retrieved from the Tracking, Shipment or Events APIs. The is_late flag is reset if the shipment is updated with new promised_date information (as long as the new promised_date has not also already elapsed). If is_late is reset to false , then hours_late is reset to NULL. Note The is_late shipment property should not be confused with the Late shipment state. Like all other shipment states, the Late shipment state is assigned on the basis of a carrier tracking event that REACT has received. Simply put, the is_late property is used when REACT notices a shipment is late, while the Late shipment state is used when a carrier tells Sorted that the shipment is late. Trackable Shipments To optimise performance, REACT periodically marks old shipments as \"non-trackable\". The system only performs may_be_missing and lateness calculations on trackable shipments. A shipment is deemed to be non-trackable if any of the following criteria are met: The shipment is domestic (i.e. the addresses.country_iso_code of its origin and destination addresses is identical) AND Sorted has not received a tracking event for it in seven or more days. The shipment is international (i.e. the addresses.country_iso_code of its origin and destination addresses is different) AND Sorted has not received a tracking event for it in 10 or more days. Note If Sorted do not know whether a shipment is domestic or international (that is, it does not have a addresses.country_iso_code recorded for both its origin and destination addresses), then it is assumed to be domestic. The shipment is in a final state AND Sorted has not received a tracking event for it in three or more days. Final States REACT uses \"final shipment states\" when determining whether shipments are lost or potentially missing. The list of final states covers all the potential outcomes for a shipment delivery. Once a shipment enters a final state, its journey is considered to have ended and REACT no longer tracks it. The full list of final states is: delivered delivered_damaged delivered_to_neighbour delivered_to_reception delivered_to_safe_location destroyed lost carrier_refused_to_collect carrier_unable_to_collect delivered delivery_failed delivery_failed_card_left delivery_refused delivery_rescheduled exchange_failed partially_delivered proof_of_delivery_available ready_for_collection Using Calculated Properties Although set by REACT, the lateness and may_be_missing flags are standard properties and can be integrated in exactly the same way as any other shipment data. They are returned by the Shipments and Events APIs,as part of the Shipment and Shipment Events resources. Note For more information on retrieving data via REACT's APIs, see the Retrieving Shipment and Event Data page. Viewing Calculated Properties in the UI The UI's Calculated Events dashboard displays the number of your shipments that REACT has flagged as Late or May Be Missing . To open the Calculated Events dashboard, select the Dashboards > Calculated Events menu option. Note For more information on monitoring shipments in the REACT UI, see the Monitoring Shipments page.

This section explains how to call REACT's API endpoints. API Headers in REACT To call any of REACT's APIs, you'll need an API key. You can create one from the Settings > API Keys tab in the REACT UI. Note For more information on getting a REACT API key, see the Setting up API keys section of the Settings page. To use your API key, include it in an x-api-key header when making an API call. We also recommend that you include JSON Content-Type and Accept headers too, as REACT only works with JSON data. REACT Endpoints REACT offers the following API endpoints: Endpoint Purpose Register Shipments Register shipments for tracking Get Shipment by Shipment ID Retrieve shipment details by REACT Shipment ID Get Shipments Retrieve shipment details by tracking or custom reference Update Shipment Update shipment details Delete Shipment Delete a shipment Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID Retrieve all shipment tracking events for a specified shipment Get Event Retrieve events by REACT Event ID Get Shipment Events Retrieve events by date range, references and carrier Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID Retrieve event details by REACT Shipment ID Get Shipment States History Retrieve a shipment's shipment state history API Functions Registering Shipments - Explains how to use the Register Shipments endpoint and the SFTP bulk upload service to add shipments to REACT.

This page explains how to register shipment details by API, SFTP, and email, and how to get the most out of REACT by registering additional shipment information. Registering Shipments by API The Register Shipments API endpoint enables you to send shipment details to REACT. REACT then uses these details to create a shipment record on the system. Sending the Request To register a shipment, send a POST request to https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments . There are lots of properties you can send when you register, but only the (carrier) tracking_references array is mandatory. REACT treats the value of the tracking_references array as the shipment's primary reference. Currently, you can only provide one tracking reference in the tracking_references array, although multiple references may be supported in a future enhancement to REACT. If you add additional references, REACT returns an error. You can add additional references for the shipment - including your own internal reference numbers - in the custom_references array. Note As with other REACT APIs, you'll need to include JSON Content-Type and Accept headers and a valid API key in order to use the Register Shipments endpoint. You can get an API key from the Settings > API Keys page of the REACT UI. For more information on obtaining an API key, see the Getting an API Key section of the Quick Start guide. Examples This example shows the body of a simple Register Shipments request, in which the user has not provided any information other than a carrier tracking reference: Single Register Shipments Request { \"shipments\": [{ \"tracking_references\": [\"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE\"] }] } The following example shows two simple shipments registered in a single API call: Double Register Shipments Request { \"shipments\": [{ \"tracking_references\": [\"MULTI-SHIPMENT-1\"] }, { \"tracking_references\": [\"MULTI-SHIPMENT-2\"] }] } Register Shipments Response When REACT receives the request, it creates a new shipment record and returns a 201 Created response. The body of this response contains the shipment's id - a REACT-generated identifier for the shipment that can be used to recall data throughout REACT's APIs. Successful Register Shipments Response { \"id\": \"sp_TRACKING-DEMO-ID\", \"message\": \"Shipment record 'sp_TRACKING-DEMO-ID' with tracking reference [\"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE\"] registered successfully.\", \"tracking_references\": [ \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE\" ], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/sp_TRACKING-DEMO-ID\", \"rel\": \"self\" } ] } And that's it! REACT will look out for the tracking reference you provided in the carrier data it receives from its carrier connectors, and will update the shipment's information as new events come in. You can use the carrier tracking reference or {id} to get updates on the shipment using REACT's APIs. The newly-registered shipment can also trigger any webhooks you have configured. REACT assigns an initial shipment state of Registered to all newly-registered shipments. For a full list of REACT shipment states, see the Shipment States page. Registering Shipments by SFTP The Register Shipments API is ideal if you need to register shipments individually or in small groups. However, if you have a large number of shipments to register you might find it more practical to use REACT's SFTP upload facility. Prerequisites In order to upload to the REACT SFTP service, you will need a REACT SFTP account and private key. For more information on obtaining these details, see Setting up SFTP Accounts . Note REACT private keys are provided in PPK format. If your SFTP client does not support PPK keys then you will need to convert the key provided into the appropriate format. Consult your SFTP client's documentation for further information. The shipment data you want to upload should be stored in either a JSON or CSV file. The shipment data in this file should be structured in the same way as the data accepted by the Register Shipments endpoint, with one exception: when uploading a CSV file, the property that accepts tracking references should be called tracking_reference , rather than tracking_references (plural) as is the case when uploading a JSON file or making a direct request to the Register Shipments endpoint. Note For more information on representing shipment data in CSV format, see the CSV File Structure section. For more information on the data structure of the Register Shipments requests, see the API Reference . This example shows the body of a simple CSV upload, in which the user has registered the carrier tracking references of five shipments, along with the carriers and carrier services used for those shipments: CSV Upload \"tracking_reference\",\"carrier\",\"carrier_service\" \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE1\",\"A Carrier\",\"A Carrier Service\" \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE2\",\"Another Carrier\",\"Another Carrier Service\" \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE3\",\"A Carrier\",\"A Carrier Service\" \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE4\",\"Another Carrier\",\"Another Carrier Service\" \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE5\",\"A Carrier\",\"A Carrier Service\" Uploading To upload shipments to REACT via SFTP: Save the private key to the machine you will be uploading the files from. From that machine, open an SFTP client and start a new SFTP session. You'll need the following login details: File Protocol: SFTP Host Name: sftp://react-sftp.sorted.com Port Number: 22 Your REACT SFTP username and passphrase . Upload the shipment file as per your SFTP client's instructions. SFTP Upload Results Once you have uploaded the file, REACT processes the shipment data sent. The system takes each individual shipment object in the file and attempts to register is using the data supplied. As the shipments are processed, REACT writes the result of each registration attempt to a JSON file. Once REACT has attempted to register every shipment in the file, the original file is deleted and the results file is uploaded to your SFTP directory. The completed file gives a full breakdown of how many shipments were successfully registered, how many could not be registered, and any errors that were returned. The results file has two arrays of errors: validation_errors : Generated if the shipment could not be registered due to its data failing REACT's validation checks. registration_errors : Generated if the shipment passed REACT's validation but still could not be registered. (i.e. REACT's response to the shipment had a status code of something other than 201 Created or 400 Bad Request .) Example SFTP Result Files The file contained a single shipment, which was successfully uploaded. SFTP Result File 1 { \"result_message\":\"Results for processing file shipments-1-valid.json\", \"original_filename\":\"shipments-1-valid.json\", \"total_lines\":1, \"successful_shipment_registrations\":1, \"unsucessful_shipment_registrations\":0, \"validation_errors\":[ ], \"registration_errors\":[ ], \"error_message\":null, \"process_start\":\"2018-11-13T10:49:40.7613486+00:00\", \"process_end\":\"2018-11-13T10:49:41.0246588+00:00\" } The file contained four shipments. One was registered successfully, one failed due to a validation error (in this case, duplicate tracking_reference values), and two failed due to errors during the registration process. SFTP Result File 2 { \"result_message\":\"Results for processing file EXAMPLE-FILENAME\", \"original_filename\":\"EXAMPLE-FILENAME\", \"total_lines\":4, \"successful_shipment_registrations\":1, \"unsucessful_shipment_registrations\":3, \"validation_errors\": [ { \"tracking_reference\":\"trackRef2\", \"message\":\"1 or more validation error(s) occurred\", \"error_messages\": [ { \"property\":\"shipments._tracking_reference\", \"message\":\"Only one Tracking Reference should be provided\" } ] } ], \"registration_errors\": [ { \"tracking_reference\":\"trackRef3\", \"error_message\":\"We were unable to register this shipment status was Ambiguous\" }, { \"tracking_reference\":\"trackRef4\", \"error_message\":\"We could not register this shipment as an error occured\" } ], \"error_message\":null, \"process_start\":\"2018-11-08T11:01:41.989049+00:00\", \"process_end\":\"2018-11-08T11:01:42.0460531+00:00\" } The file could not be parsed at all, most likely due to an invalid structure: SFTP Result File 3 { \"result_message\":\"There was a problem processing the file shipments-1-valid.csv\", \"original_filename\":\"shipments-1-valid.csv\", \"total_lines\":0, \"successful_shipment_registrations\":0, \"unsucessful_shipment_registrations\":0, \"validation_errors\":[ ], \"registration_errors\":[ ], \"error_message\":\"Error parsing header from location cu-17583829045847028000-sorted-copy/shipments-1-valid-636777032692975629.csv for customer cu_17583829045847028000\", \"process_start\":\"2018-11-13T10:54:30.7505662+00:00\", \"process_end\":\"2018-11-13T10:54:34.2508169+00:00\" } You can upload multiple shipment files at the same time as long as the files have different names. If you attempt to upload two shipment files with the same name at the same time, or upload a file before another file of the same name has finished processing, then REACT will only process one file. However, REACT will process files that have the same name as a file that has been previously uploaded, as long as it has already finished processing the first file. Registering Shipments by Email REACT's Register by Email functionality enables you to register shipments in REACT without having to make an API call or SFTP upload. Registering shipments by email enables less-technical users, and those users who do not have access to make API calls or upload via SFTP, to set shipments up for tracking. Each authorised Register by Email account has its own destination email address. Simply blind carbon copy (BCC) this address in to an email containing shipment details to register a new shipment. Authorising your Email Address In order to register shipments by email, you will first need to authorise your email address as a sender. To authorise your email address: Click Settings > Shipments by Email to display the Email Shipment Registration page. Click Edit on the Authorised Emails tile to display the Authorised Emails page. Click Add Email to display the Add Authorised Email page. Enter an Authorised Email Address and click the Make This Active check box. Click Add to register the address. REACT displays a dialog containing an auto-generated unique registration email address. Make a note of the registration email address. This is the address you should send shipment data to from the email address that you registered. Click Accept to close the dialog and return to the Authorised Emails page. The newly-authorised email address is displayed as a tile on this page. Note The process of authorising your email address to register shipments is entirely separate from the account creation process. You will need to perform the process detailed above for every email address that you want to use to register shipments. Managing Authorised Email Addresses You can edit your existing authorised email addresses from the Settings > Shipments by Email > Authorised Emails page. Editing Existing Addresses To edit an existing address, click its Edit button. REACT displays the Editing Authorised Email page for that address. Make the required edits and click Update to save your changes. Deactivating Existing Addresses To deactivate an existing address, click the Active toggle on the address tile. The toggle switches to the Inactive position, confirming that the address has been deactivated. Deactivating an address means that you can no longer use it to register shipments. However, its configuration is saved, and you can reactivate the address by clicking the toggle again. Deleting Existing Addresses To permanently delete an address, click its Delete button. REACT displays a confirmation dialog. Click Yes to delete the address. Deleting an address permanently removes all of its configuration. To reinstate a deleted address you would need to set it up again. Sending a Registration Email In order to register a shipment, blind carbon copy (BCC) your registration recipient email address in to an email containing an XML shipment object. Include the details of the shipment in the body of your email. Unlike the JSON objects used in REACT API calls, a shipment sent by email must be represented as an XML object. For security reasons, the properties of the XML object must be empty, with the shipment values you want to register expressed as XML value attributes within each tag. Note You can only register shipments by blind-copying your recipient email address into a shipment. The registration will not work if you send the email to the recipient directly. This process enables you to register shipments using, for example, the delivery dispatch notifications you send to your customers. In order to do so, you would send the email to the end customer but BCC the registration recipient into the same email, as well as adding the relevant XML shipment details to the body of the notification. The example below shows a blank shipment record in valid Register by Email format. Email Example <react_shipments> <react_shipment> <react_tracking_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_tracking_reference value=\"y\" /> <react_package_tracking_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_custom_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_custom_reference value=\"y\" /> <react_tags value=\"x\" /> <react_tags value=\"y\" /> <react_carrier value=\"x\" /> <react_carrier_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_carrier_service value=\"x\" /> <react_shipped_date value=\"x\" /> <react_order_date value=\"x\" /> <react_promised_date_start value=\"x\" /> <react_promised_date_end value=\"x\" /> <react_expected_delivery_date_start value=\"x\" /> <react_expected_delivery_date_end value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_address_type value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_address_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_property_number value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_property_name value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_address_line1 value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_address_line2 value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_address_line3 value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_locality value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_region value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_postal_code value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_country_iso_code value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_lat_long_latitude value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_0_lat_long_longitude value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_address_type value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_address_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_property_number value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_property_name value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_address_line1 value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_address_line2 value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_address_line3 value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_locality value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_region value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_postal_code value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_country_iso_code value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_lat_long_latitude value=\"x\" /> <react_addresses_1_lat_long_longitude value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_email value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_phone value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_mobile_phone value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_first_name value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_last_name value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_middle_name value=\"x\" /> <react_consumer_title value=\"x\" /> <react_retailer value=\"x\" /> <react_metadata value=\"x\" key=\"k\" type=\"t\" /> <react_metadata value=\"y\" key=\"l\" type=\"s\" /> <react_shipment_type value=\"x\" /> <react_shipping_location_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_tenant_reference value=\"x\" /> <react_channel_reference value=\"x\" /> </react_shipment> </react_shipments> The available properties are the same as a standard shipment request, as detailed in the REACT API Reference . Only the format of the request is different. As with other methods of registration, only the tracking_references property is mandatory when registering shipments by email. All other properties are optional. If required, you can add additional content to the email before or after the shipment object. You can register multiple shipments in the same email using the format below: Multiple Shipments <react_shipments> <react_shipment> x </react_shipment> <react_shipment> y </react_shipment> </react_shipments> Register by Email Worked Example The example below shows the same shipment represented in both JSON (as per a Register Shipments API call) and XML (as per a Register by Email request).

To see a list of your Invalid Register Shipment files, select Settings > Shipments by Email > Invalid Register Shipment Files . Assigning a Carrier on Registration You can specify a shipment's carrier at the point of registration using the carrier_reference property. carrier_reference is not a mandatory property, but Sorted recommends that you provide carrier details where possible. If you provide a carrier_reference , then REACT can instantly link your shipment to the correct carrier and begin receiving tracking information sooner than it would otherwise be able to. Where provided, the carrier_reference property must contain a carrier's unique REACT ID. If you provide any other value in a carrier_reference property, then REACT returns a 400 - Bad Request validation error. Looking Up Carrier References Each REACT carrier has its own identifier within the system. The table below shows the unique IDs for some common REACT carriers: Name Reference Hermes UK 26432E9D-73CB-44EF-ABB5-164088A93ABE ArrowXL E2B36840-4032-49A9-981F-44A7097AFDFE DHL Express 532D2CE2-79DC-4E24-840C-C75A37CF02DC DPD Local UK F8714833-FB20-45DE-8563-CDE2D8EFA985 Asda toyou F1535C2B-10C8-4D43-9976-11848DEA013D P2P TRAKPAK 19E6AEA5-278D-476A-8576-D4DBC3C2DD94 Yodel 77B7A461-E3B3-4B2C-9B90-2F42FE4BFC25 Royal Mail B5096289-91F4-49E2-9B8E-018964877C5E DHL Parcel UK FFC0644D-B570-413F-A6B8-CC4F20B491A0 DPD UK D1FB3EA4-7AA4-4D50-B1F3-9AF69A582038 Parcelforce 57E2A30D-368B-4F42-9E20-5F6B3A5115BC Lineten 00e32b3c-87d6-4fe3-ad79-d21133469eae TNT 385a136e-8a1a-405f-b6a8-35bd7e2c7bd8 FedEx 5FE878CB-32BF-4221-B2BF-45C89739825D DPD Germany 0b664aa8-da77-4f97-ab44-0749acbe8ccb DHL Paket 6A7657AE-EB7E-459F-B3A8-1A6C10D8B205 UPS 121DB19E-8356-428A-BB6C-4A53DA8C0389 Jersey Post 911a07c3-3e48-4875-bd07-cf1b37465c33 DX Freight e48028d6-35b7-48a8-a542-4c7edb4dbee1 Panther e75a59d7-205e-b1a8-b8ad-e1786de37e21 APG 50d10273-d750-4cdc-8db9-c70bd9099b69 Asendia 0F7FD87E-3F95-4203-A397-11F81DC2C4DA Fastway 2539E909-6C0B-4D70-8C3E-2CE4CD16CA4C Landmark Global e9d32156-bac3-4f15-b658-ae6e460212d0 Collectplus B3109373-EF07-4A2E-B5FA-89283BE33691 REACT is continually being updated with new carriers, and as such the table above should not be considered an exhaustive list. You can look up a carrier reference in the REACT UI via the Carrier Connectors page. To do so: Log in to the REACT UI and select the Settings > Carrier Connectors page. Click the Edit button on the tile of the carrier you want to look up to display the Edit Configuration page for that carrier. Scroll to the bottom of the page. The carrier's reference is displayed in the Carrier Reference field. Registering Extra Shipment Information Registering shipments with a carrier tracking reference alone is enough to get started with REACT's tracking features, but REACT works best when you give it more shipment data to use. Note This section gives an overview of the extra information you can provide when registering a shipment. For full details of all the properties accepted by the Register Shipments endpoint, and the structure you should use when making the request, see the API Reference . The Register Shipments endpoint enables you to register: References - As well as the mandatory carrier tracking reference array, you can also register additional custom_references for the shipment. Custom references do not need to be unique (i.e. you can register the same custom reference for multiple shipments if required), but we would recommend that you use unique custom references where possible to help you retrieve shipment data easily. Tags - Tags enable you to associate related shipments (such as all shipments of a particular product, or all shipments of products on special offer) with each other. You can also use tags to select the shipments that go into your shipment filters. Note You can add up to 20 tags to a shipment, and each tag must be between three and 30 characters long. If you attempt to add more than 20 tags then only the first 20 are stored. Tags are not case-sensitive, and you cannot add duplicate tags within the same shipment. Dates - The order_date , shipped_date and promised_date properties enable you to record when a shipment was ordered and shipped, and when the customer was told that it would be delivered. Addresses - The addresses array enables you to record multiple addresses against a single shipment. You can record origin, destination, return, billing, delivery hub, and alternative delivery addresses. Consumer Info - The consumer array enables you to record your customer's contact details. Shipment Types - The shipment_type property enables you to record whether a shipment is a delivery, return, pick up, drop off, combined drop off / pick up, or return drop off. Custom Metadata - You can specify custom metadata properties using the metadata array. Each property requires a key , value , and data type . Note Adding metadata enables you to group shipments together so that they can be tracked from the same page, and to use custom properties to enrich the notifications that you send to your customers. For more information on grouping shipments, see the Grouping Shipments page. For more information on configuring notifications, see the Configuring Notifications page. Simulated Tracking - Simulated tracking is a means of generating dummy tracking events for testing or demonstration purposes. For a user guide on working with simulated tracking, see the Using Simulated Tracking . Why Register Additional Information? If you only provide a carrier reference when registering then REACT is limited to reporting back on what the carrier says about that particular shipment. Providing additional information enables REACT to do the following: Offer flexible retrieval options - Some of REACT's API endpoints enable you to retrieve shipments, events or tracking events based on criteria other than REACT {id} numbers or carrier references. For example, you can use the Get Shipments endpoint to retrieve shipment details based on custom references, such as your own internal order number for the shipment in question. However, REACT can only return a shipment via custom reference if you've previously supplied a custom reference for that shipment. Also, adding tags to your shipments enables you to fine-tune the list of shipments that you receive webhooks for. For example, you might have a \"Special-Offer\" tag that you would apply to shipments of products in a particular sale. You could then set up a shipment filter including only those shipments with your \"Special-Offer\" tag. This shipment filter could in turn be used to power a webhook sending branded offer-specific delivery communications to customers who have purchased products in the sale. Provide rich webhook and API results - Adding additional shipment data enables REACT's webhooks and APIs to return richer results. When triggered, webhooks send a ShipmentEvents object to you. As well as event details, this object contains a ShipmentSummary - an overview of the data REACT holds on the shipment in question. The more information REACT holds on the shipment, the more useful this ShipmentSummary will be. Offer enhanced UI functionality - You will need to provide additional shipment information in order to use the Dashboard's data filters. You can filter Dashboard data by carrier, state, country of origin, destination country, important dates, and shipment type, but only for those shipments that have the relevant information recorded. In addition, shipments will only show up on the States dashboard map if they have an address with an address_type of Origin . Use Calculated Properties - If you add a promised_date to your shipments then REACT can automatically mark shipments as late where required. Likewise, adding a country_iso_code for both destination and origin addresses enables REACT to perform may_be_missing calculations, in which it marks a shipment as potentially missing if that shipment is not updated for a set period of time. Example Detailed JSON Request The following example shows a shipment registered with additional detail on tags, dates, consumer information, and custom tracking references. For full details of all the properties accepted by the Register Shipments endpoint, see the API Reference . Detailed Register Shipment Request { \"shipments\": [ { \"tags\": [ \"Special_Offer\", \"BRAND_X\", \"DTWD\" ], \"tracking_references\": [ \"TRK098JKH54ADD\" ], \"custom_references\": [ \"fb60aa0f3e2d4247b8e01c659d621b8e\", \"HB-003\" ], \"carrier_reference\": \"F1535C2B-10C8-4D43-9976-11848DEA013D\", \"shipped_date\": \"2018-11-12T00:00:00+00:00\", \"order_date\": \"2018-11-12T00:00:00+00:00\", \"promised_date\": { \"start\": \"2018-11-19T09:00:00+00:00\", \"end\": \"2018-11-19T12:00:00+00:00\" }, \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"origin\", \"reference\": \"555d66aa24864fbdae58d8c13afb51e0\" }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"postal_code\": \"N2 3FD\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" } ], \"consumer\": { \"reference\": \"JYvkxEdlxE2Xeiv2W5W8TA\", \"email\": \"frankie_smith100@outlook.com\", \"phone\": \"+44161559844\", \"mobile_phone\": \"+447395654853\", \"first_name\": \"Francesca\", \"last_name\": \"Smith\", \"middle_name\": \"Helena\", \"title\": \"Ms\" }, \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"warehouse_identifier\", \"value\": \"WHF-0099282323A6\", \"type\": \"String\" }, { \"key\": \"refundable\", \"value\": \"false\", \"type\": \"Boolean\" }, { \"key\": \"expiration_date\", \"value\": \"2025-10-03T00:00\", \"type\": \"DateTime\" } ], \"retailer\": \"Smith & Gold GmbH\", \"shipment_type\": \"delivery\" } ] } This example has values specified in the custom_references array. These could be internal order numbers, customer references, or anything else you choose. Now that REACT has been given this data, you could use these references to retrieve information via the Get Shipment Events and Get Shipments endpoints. In this case, the metadata array has been used to add a warehouse SKU, indicate whether the shipment is refundable, and provide an expiration data for the shipment contents. REACT validates all Register Shipment requests in line with the rules set out in the API reference. Where an uploaded shipment does not meet this validation, REACT returns an error. CSV File Structure Adding additional information when registering shipments via SFTP may require you to represent complex objects in your CSV. CSV objects are represented as [object name]/[property name] . Objects can be nested within objects using the syntax [Parent object name]/[Child object name]/[property name] . Where an object can take multiple records (such as the addresses object, which can be used to record multiple addresses against a single shipment), a record number is added directly after each instance of the object in question. Record numbers should start from 0. For example, multiple addresses could be represented as: CSV - Multiple Addresses \"\"addresses/0/address_type\",\"addresses/0/postal_code\",\"addresses/0/lat_long/latitude\",\"addresses/0/lat_long/longitude\",\"addresses/1/address_type\",\"addresses/1/postal_code\",\"addresses/1/lat_long/latitude\",\"addresses/1/lat_long/longitude\" \"origin\",\"ST4 4EG\",\"123\",\"456\",\"destination\",\"M33 5EW\",\"789\",\"012\" Examples The following examples represent the same data structure: JSON CSV { \"shipments\": [ { \"tracking_references\": [ \"TRK098JKH54ADD\" ], \"custom_references\": [ \"29ab72c406a94efb8e0797deb309ee4d\", \"HB-003\" ], \"carrier_reference\": \"F1535C2B-10C8-4D43-9976-11848DEA013D\", \"addresses\": [ { \"address_type\": \"origin\", \"postal_code\": \"ST4 4EG\", \"lat_long\": { \"latitude\": \"80\", \"longitude\": \"179\" }, }, { \"address_type\": \"destination\", \"postal_code\": \"N2 3FD\", \"country_iso_code\": \"GB\" } ], } ] } \"tracking_reference\",\"custom_references/0\",\"custom_references/1\",\"carrier_reference\",\"addresses/0/address_type\",\"addresses/0/postal_code\",\"addresses/0/lat_long/latitude\",\"addresses/0/lat_long/longitude\",\"addresses/1/address_type\",\"addresses/1/postal_code\",\"addresses/1/country_iso_code\" \"TRK098JKH54ADD\",\"29ab72c406a94efb8e0797deb309ee4d\",\"HB-003\",\"F1535C2B-10C8-4D43-9976-11848DEA013D\",\"origin\",\"ST4 4EG\",\"123\",\"456\",\"destination\",\"N2 3FD\",\"GB\" Note By default, shipments are archived 35 days after registration. Archived shipments are no longer available on the REACT platform. Next Steps Learn more about integrating with REACT: Retrieving Shipment and Event Data Updating Shipments Error Codes"

This page explains the endpoints you can use to get this information, and the format in which the information is returned. Tracking in REACT REACT has three APIs that enable you to retrieve information. The Shipment API enables you to retrieve full details of one or more shipments. The Tracking API enables you to retrieve carrier tracking event details in a standardised format. This is the API that you would likely use to drive embedded tracking on your site or apps. The Events API enables you to retrieve details of events within REACT (for example, an address or shipment state change). Note All REACT APIs require you to include JSON Content-Type and Accept headers and a valid API key as request headers. You can get an API key from the Settings > API Keys page of the REACT UI. For more information on obtaining an API key, see the Getting an API Key section of the Quick Start guide. Retrieving Shipments REACT has two endpoints that you can use to get shipment details: Get Shipments - Takes shipment tracking_references and custom_references and returns details of all shipments that meet those criteria. Get Shipment by Shipment ID - Takes a shipment {id} and returns details of the corresponding shipment. Get Shipment by Shipment ID Endpoint The Get Shipment by Shipment ID endpoint returns details of a single shipment by that shipment's REACT {id} . To use the Get Shipment by Shipment ID endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/{id} . You can only use this API to get details of your own shipments. If you attempt to get details of another customer's shipments, REACT returns an error. Get Shipments Endpoint The Get Shipments endpoint returns details of all shipments that meet your search criteria. It accepts the following parameters: Parameter Description Format Example Start Returns all shipments that were created after the supplied timestamp Unix time start=1543920000 End Returns all shipments that were created before the supplied timestamp Unix time end=1543926896 Tracking References Returns the shipment that has the specified tracking reference String tracking_reference=TRK098JKH54ADD Custom References Returns all shipments that have the specified custom reference String custom_references=HB-003 Page Returns a particular page of results Integer page=2 To use the Get Shipments endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/search?start=timestamp&end=timestamp&tracking_references=strings&custom_references=strings&page=int . Note You can only retrieve shipments by custom_references if you have previously registered that information for the relevant shipments. For more information on registering shipment information, see the Registering Shipments page. None of the search parameters are mandatory in themselves, but at least one search parameter must be provided. If you do not provide at least one search parameter, then REACT returns a validation error. The timestamp parameters must be provided in pairs. If you provide a start value with no corresponding end value (or vice versa), then REACT returns a validation error. Timestamps should be provided as UTC time. If neither timestamp is specified, then REACT searches for shipments created in the last 28 days (including today). You can only add a maximum of one tracking_reference to your request. As such, you can only return one shipment at a time when searching by tracking_reference . To search for multiple shipments at once, use custom_references . You can add multiple custom_references by appending additional &custom_references=(strings) parameters to the end of the link. REACT treats multiple custom_references as an AND operation, and will return only those shipments that contain all provided references. Where a valid request is made but no matching shipments are found, REACT returns an empty array with a link to the resource itself. Note that in this scenario the response has a code 200 OK rather than 404 Not Found , as the request itself is valid even though there are no shipments currently matching your search criteria. No Matching Shipments Example { \"shipments\": [], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/search?trackingReferences=nonexistenttrackingreference\", \"rel\": \"self\" } ] } As with all REACT APIs, the Get Shipments endpoint retrieves a maximum of 200 records with any single request. Where more than 200 records exist, paging links to the next and previous set of results, as well as the first and last set of results, are returned. The page parameter enables you to request a particular page of results. See the Paging Results section for more information on paging in REACT's APIs. The Shipment Resource Both Get Shipments endpoints return Shipment resources. The Shipment resource contains the information provided when the shipment was registered. For more information on the information that REACT accepts when registering a shipment, see the Registering Shipments doc page and the Register Shipments API reference . As well as the shipment's registration information, the Shipment resource contains some REACT-generated properties that could be particularly useful when embedding tracking pages on your website or app: shipment.shipment_state.state - Contains the shipment's current REACT shipment state. REACT uses carrier tracking events to calculate this value. For a full list of available REACT shipment states, see the Shipment States page. shipment.shipment_state.state_label - Contains the customer-facing label for the shipment's current state. You can customise shipment state labels using the Custom State Labels UI page. If you have not set a custom label up for the shipment state then this field contains the default label text. Note The Custom State Labels UI page enables you to set up custom labels in multiple languages. By default, REACT's APIs and webhooks return labels in en-gb (English - United Kingdom). To retrieve labels in languages other than en-gb , add an accept-language header with the relevant language code as its value to your API request. For example, to retrieve language labels in German, you would first need to use the Customise Shipment State Labels page to add German labels to your shipment states. You would then add an accept-language header with a value of de to any API requests you made. In its response, REACT would populate the state_label field with your German labels. shipment.delivered_date - The date and time on which the shipment was delivered. REACT automatically records this information when a shipment enters a state of Delivered , Delivered to Neighbour , Delivered to Reception , or Delivered to Safe Location . shipment.may_be_missing - Indicates whether REACT believes that the shipment may be missing. REACT marks shipments as may_be_missing if they are not updated within a set time period after registration, or if they are not marked as delivered, lost, or refused within a different set time period. REACT can only perform may_be_missing calculations for shipments that have a country_iso_code recorded for their origin and destination addresses. shipment.lateness.late and shipment.lateness.hours_late - These properties indicate whether REACT believes a shipment to be late, and (where applicable) how many hours late this shipment is. REACT can only perform lateness calculations for shipments that have a promised_date recorded. Note This section gives a high-level overview of the information returned by the Get Shipments endpoints. For full reference details of the data returned, see the Get Shipment Events and Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID sections of the API reference. Retrieving Tracking Events The Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID endpoint enables you to get details of carrier tracking events. Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID takes a shipment {id} and returns all tracking events associated with that shipment, as well as a summary of shipment details. To use the Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/tracking/search?shipment_id=string . The Tracking Events Resource The Tracking API returns a Shipment Tracking Events resource. The Shipment Tracking Events resource contains details of all tracking events related to a particular shipment and a summary of the shipment itself. The tracking information in the Shipment Tracking Events resource takes a standardised format, with the same data structure used for all carriers. The Shipment Tracking Events resource has two parts: ShipmentSummary - This object contains a summary of the data REACT holds on the shipment, including tags, reference numbers, carrier information and expected dates. events - This array contains details of all tracking events associated with the shipment in question. The ShipmentSummary object contains all the information in the Shipments resource, except for the following: Consumer details. Address information. Carrier service details. Shipping and order dates. The events object contains any tracking events that are associated with the selected shipment. Each Tracking Event resource contains details on an individual carrier tracking event, including: ID - A REACT-generated unique identifier for the tracking event. Dates and Times - The timestamps at which that the event occurred and was received by REACT. Event Code - The REACT event code. Event Description Signee - The name of the signee for the shipment, where applicable. Location - A text description of the location at which the tracking event occurred. Latitude / Longitude - The latitude and longitude of the location at which the event occurred. If REACT finds a shipment that meets your criteria, but that shipment does not have associated tracking events, then the Tracking API returns a response containing shipment details only. This feature enables you to distinguish between a 404 Not Found response in which data matching the supplied details could not be found, and a 200 OK response in which a matching shipment was found but that shipment did not contain any tracking event data. Note This section gives a brief overview of the contents of the Tracking Event resource. For full reference information, see the Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID section of the API reference. Retrieving Events You can get event details using the following endpoints: Get Shipment Events - Takes various shipment-related parameters and returns details of all events associated with the selected shipments, as well as summaries of the shipments themselves. Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID - Takes a shipment.id and returns all events associated with that shipment, as well as a summary of shipment details. You can only retrieve events which are associated with your organisation's shipments. REACT returns an error if you attempt to retrieve another organisation's event details. REACT events are not the same as carrier tracking events. REACT uses events to track changes in shipment state. An event is generated whenever one of the following occurs: A shipment's shipment_state changes. A shipment's promised_date or shipped_date changes. Tip The Events API returns the same data as REACT's webhooks. You may want to consider implementing webhooks rather than integrating Events endpoints, as webhooks enable REACT to send event data proactively rather than requiring you to make a request. For more information on implementing webhooks, see the Managing Webhooks page. The Get Shipment Events Endpoint The Get Shipment Events endpoint returns details of all events related to a particular shipment or group of shipments, as well as a summary of the shipments themselves. It accepts the following parameters: Parameter Description Format Example Start Returns all events that occurred after the supplied timestamp Unix time start=1543920000 End Returns all events that occurred before the supplied timestamp Unix time end=1543926896 Tracking References Returns all events associated with the specified shipment String tracking_reference=TRK098JKH54ADD Custom References Returns all events associated with the specified shipment(s) String custom_references=HB-003 Carrier Returned all events associated with the specified carrier's shipments String carrier=CarrierX To use the Get Shipment Events endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?start=timestamp&end=timestamp&tracking_references=strings&custom_references=strings&carrier=strings . None of the search parameters are mandatory in themselves, but at least one search parameter must be provided. If you do not provide at least one search parameter, then REACT returns a validation error. The timestamp parameters must be provided in pairs. If you provide a start value with no corresponding end value (or vice versa), then REACT returns a validation error. Timestamps should be provided as UTC time. As with all REACT APIs, the Get Shipment Events endpoint retrieves a maximum of 200 records with any single request. Where more than 200 records exist, paging links to the next and previous set of results, as well as the first and last set of results, are returned. See the Paging Results section for more information on paging in REACT's APIs. If REACT finds shipments that meet your criteria, but those shipments do not have associated events, then the Events API returns a response containing shipment details only. This feature enables you to distinguish between a 404 Not Found response in which data matching the supplied details could not be found, and a 200 OK response in which a matching shipment was found but that shipment did not contain any event data. Note This section gives a brief overview of Get Shipment Events requests. For full reference information, see the Get Shipment Events section of the API reference. The Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID Endpoint The Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID endpoint takes a shipment {id} and returns details of all events related to a particular shipment, as well as a summary of the shipment itself. To use the Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?shipment_id=string . The ShipmentEvents Resource The Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID and Get Shipment Events endpoints return ShipmentEvents resources. The ShipmentEvents resource contains details of all events related to a particular shipment and a summary of the shipment itself. The Shipment Events resource has two parts: ShipmentSummary - This object contains a summary of the data REACT holds on the shipment, including tags, reference numbers, carrier information and expected dates. events - This array contains details of all events associated with the shipment in question. The ShipmentSummary object contains all the information in the Shipments resource, except for the following: Consumer details. Address information. Carrier service details. Shipping and order dates. Custom metadata fields. The events object contains the following information: ID - A REACT-generated unique identifier for the event. Event Type - The event's type (e.g. state_change or rescheduled ). Timestamp - The time that the event occurred. Message - A brief message describing the event. Property Summary - Details of any changes that were made to the shipment's shipment.shipment_state.state , shipment.delivered_date , shipment.promised_date , and shipment.shipped_date properties, including whether each property was changed as a result of the event, the property's value before the event, and the property's value after the event. Within the events object, events are grouped by the action that triggered them. The EventGroup object contains an array of individual events. Each EventGroup has a Trigger property containing details of the action that triggered the event, including the initiator (for example, the carrier or user), a brief message describing the trigger, and a timestamp. EventGroup s can be identified by correlation_id - a REACT-generated string assigned to groups of events. As an example of event grouping, let's suppose that the following sequence of events has occurred: A carrier was unable to deliver a shipment, and left a calling card. The customer has called the carrier to indicate that they would like to pick the shipment up from a click and collect point. The carrier has put the shipment back out for delivery to the click and collect point and recorded the promised_date that the customer was advised the shipment would be reading for collection by. The carrier update would cause two events to be generated: one with an EventType of state_change , and one with an EventType of key_property_change . These events would be grouped into the same EventGroup object, because they were triggered by the same action. Note This section gives a brief overview of the ShipmentEvents resource. For full reference information, see the Get Shipment Events section of the API reference. Retrieving Shipment State History You can also use the Events API to get further information on shipment states. The Get Shipment States History endpoint takes a shipment {id} and returns a history of the shipment states that a particular shipment has been in. To use the Get Shipment States History endpoint, send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/events/shipment-states?{id} . The Shipment State Events Resource The Get Shipment States History endpoint returns a Shipment State Events resource. In addition to the relevant shipment ID, this resource contains an array of ShipmentStateEvent objects, one for each state that that shipment has assumed. Each of these objects contains the following data: State - The state that the shipment assumed. Label - The custom label corresponding to that shipment state, where applicable. Note Custom shipment state labels enable you to explain shipment states to your customers in your brand's own tone of voice. For more information on setting up custom shipment state labels, see the Setting up Custom State Labels section of the Settings page. Timestamp - The date and time at which the shipment assumed the state in question. The following example shows the Shipment State Events resource for a shipment that has gone from Dispatched to In Transit to Delivered , with accompanying timestamps and custom labels. Shipment State Events Resource { \"shipment_id\": \"sp_18446744073709551615\", \"shipment_state_events\": [ { \"shipment_state\": \"Dispatched\", \"state_label\": \"Dispatched!\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-03-22T14:52:02.1053944+00:00\" }, { \"shipment_state\": \"In Transit\", \"state_label\": \"In Transit!\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-03-22T17:31:02.1022944+00:00\" }, { \"shipment_state\": \"Delivered\", \"state_label\": \"Delivered!\", \"timestamp\": \"2019-03-23T18:02:02.103544+00:00\" } ] } Note This section gives a brief overview of the Shipment State Events resource. For full reference information, see the Get Shipment States History section of the API reference. Paging Results REACT enables you to retrieve a maximum of 200 records with any individual API call. Where more than 200 records exist, paging links are supplied. These links enable you to retrieve the next, previous, first, and last sets of results. All paging links follow a standard format. They are returned in a _links object, located after either the 200th or final record returned, whichever is earlier. Each link takes the format [URL requested]&page=[PAGE NUMBER] For example, let's say you want to view all events for the shipments you have with Carrier X. You've sent a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?carrier=Carrier%20X&page=1 , which has found around 900 results. After the 200th record, the response from the API would include the following: Paging Links { \"_links\": [ { \"rel\": \"self\", \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?carrier=Carrier%20X&page=1\" }, { \"rel\": \"next\", \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?carrier=Carrier%20X&page=2\" }, { \"rel\": \"first\", \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?carrier=Carrier%20X&page=1\" }, { \"rel\": \"last\", \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?carrier=Carrier%20X&page=5\" } ] } To access the rest of the results, you would need to make a GET request to the relevant paging link. For example, to get the third page of results, you would use GET https://api.sorted.com/react/events/search?carrier=Carrier%20X&page=3 . The results returned are sorted by created_on date. This paging format is used across all of REACT's APIs. Next Steps Learn more about integrating with REACT: Registering Shipments Updating Shipments Error Codes"

Updating Shipments To update a registered shipment, send a PUT request to https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/{id} , where {id} is the REACT ID of the shipment you want to update. The body of the request should be a Shipment resource. This resource will to a large extent overwrite the existing shipment details. Note You must include the shipment's tracking_reference in the body of every Update Shipment request you make. If you send a request with no tracking_reference , or an amended tracking_reference property, then REACT returns a 400 - Validation error. All other Shipment properties are optional when making Update Shipment requests. For more information on available properties, see the Update Shipment API reference. REACT follows the below rules when updating shipments: Property Rule id You must include the id of the shipment in the URL so that REACT can identify the shipment to be updated. However, id is a read-only property and cannot be changed manually. tracking_references You must include the shipment's tracking_reference in the body of the request so that REACT can identify the shipment to be updated. However, tracking_reference is a read-only property and cannot be changed manually. If you send a new tracking_reference , or add additional tracking_reference values, then REACT returns a 400 - Validation error. custom_references You can update custom references at any point. REACT replaces all existing reference data with data sent in the Update Shipment request. As such, you should include all required references when making an update request, not just new references. To delete all references, send an empty custom_references array. If REACT receives a null custom_references property, no changes are made. tags You can update tags at any point. REACT replaces all existing tags with those tags sent in the Update Shipment request. As such, you should include all required tags when making an update request, not just new ones. To delete all tags, send an empty tags array. If REACT receives a null tags property, no changes are made. You can add up to 20 tags to a shipment, and each tag must be between three and 30 characters long. If you attempt to add more than 20 tags then only the first 20 are stored. Tags are not case-sensitive, and you cannot add duplicate tags within the same shipment. carrier You can update the shipment's carrier at any point. However, REACT will overwrite the carrier property if it receives a tracking event that contains a different carrier name. This property is a label only, and does not have any impact on the shipment itself. carrier_service You can update the shipment's carrier service at any point. This field is a label only, and does not have any impact on the shipment itself. shipped_date You can update the shipped date at any point. order_date You can update the order date at any point. promised_date You can update the promised date at any point. If you change this property then REACT recalculates any properties that are derived from the promised date (for example, lateness ). expected_delivery_date You can update the expected delivery date at any point. However, REACT will overwrite this property if it later receives an event that contains a change in expected date. addresses You can update addresses at any point. REACT replaces all existing address data with data sent in the Update Shipment request. As such, you should include all required addresses when making an update request, not just new addresses. To delete all addresses, send an empty addresses array. If REACT receives a null addresses property, no changes are made. shipment_type You can update the shipment type at any point. consumer You can update consumer details at any point. metadata You can update metadata at any point. REACT replaces all existing metadata with data sent in the Update Shipment request. As such, you should include all required metadata when making an update request, not just new metadata. To delete all metadata, send an empty metadata array. If REACT receives a null metadata property, no changes are made. retailer You can update retailer details at any point. Once the shipment has been updated, REACT returns a confirmation response: Update Shipment Response { \"id\": \"sp_1234567890\", \"message\": \"Shipment record 'sp_1234567890' with tracking reference ['QWERTYUIOP'] updated successfully.\", \"tracking_references\": [\"QWERTYUIOP\"], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/shipment/sp_1234567890\", \"rel\": \"self\" } ] } Deleting Shipments To delete a shipment, send a DELETE request to https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/{id} , where {id} is the REACT ID of the shipment you want to delete. You do not need to include any data in the body of the request. You can only delete shipments that belong to your organisation. Deleting a shipment means that REACT will no longer track that shipment, and you will no longer be able to use REACT's APIs and Dashboard to get information on it. Once the request has been validated, REACT returns a code 202 - Accepted with the following confirmation response in its body: Delete Shipment Response { \"id\": \"sp_1234567899900\", \"message\": \"Shipment record 'sp_1234567899900' with tracking reference ['QWERTYUIOOP'] deleted successfully.\", \"tracking_references\": [\"QWERTYUIOOP\"] } Note For more information on the properties returned by the Delete Shipment confirmation message, see the API Reference .

This page explains how to use simulated tracking in REACT. How Does Simulated Tracking Work? Ordinarily, REACT shipments are updated by external communication from carriers. When the system receives a carrier tracking event that includes changes to one of your registered shipments, REACT creates a shipment event and updates the shipment details as necessary. However, it may sometimes be necessary for REACT to generate its own tracking events. For example, you may be in the process of integrating with REACT's Get Shipment Events or Get Tracking Events endpoints, and need some non-live test data to work with. Simulated tracking is a means of generating dummy tracking events as part of a Register Shipment API call. When you register a dummy shipment (that is, a shipment that does not correspond with a real-life delivery) that has a simulated_tracking property, REACT creates its own standardised tracking and shipment events in the same way that it would if it had received \"real\" carrier tracking events for the shipment. You can then use these simulated tracking events for testing or demonstration purposes. Using Simulated Tracking Before you can receive tracking events from a particular simulated carrier, you will first need a connector for that simulated carrier. REACT can simulate tracking events from the following carriers: Yodel DPD UK DPD Local Lineten Hermes For more information on setting up carrier connectors, see the Setting Up Carrier Connectors section of the Settings page. Note In order to set up a simulated connector, you will need to enter login details for the relevant REACT simulated carrier. These details are generated by Sorted. Please contact support if you require simulated login details. Once you have set up a connector for the carrier whose tracking events you want to simulate, you can use simulated tracking by registering a shipment with a simulated_tracking property. Caution Simulated tracking should be used for testing and demonstration purposes only. Registering a simulated_tracking property for a live shipment could result in incorrect tracking data. The simulated_tracking property has two sub-properties: simulation_type is the tracking scenario you want to simulate. At present, this property can either take a value of delivered , in which REACT generates tracking events simulating an issue-free delivery, or random , in which REACT generates a random tracking scenario. carrier_reference is the name of the carrier you want to simulate tracking events for: yodel , dpd_uk , dpd_local , ``hermes , or lineten`. Once you have registered a shipment with a simulated_tracking property, REACT generates dummy carrier tracking events for that shipment in line with the tracking scenario specified. The length of time taken to generate these simulated events varies based on the simulation_type selected. The delivered scenario generates events within 20 minutes, whereas the random scenario generates events over the course of the next few days. The system treats these tracking events in the same way as it would a \"regular\" tracking event, creating corresponding shipment events and updating the shipment's properties accordingly. Note For more information on how REACT processes incoming tracking events, see the How REACT Works section of the Overview page. Example Simulated Tracking Call The example below shows a simple shipment registered with a simulated_tracking property. Register Shipment Request with Simulated Tracking { \"shipments\": [ { \"tracking_references\": [ \"sim_tracking_example\" ], \"simulated_tracking\": { \"simulation_type\": \"random\", \"carrier_reference\": \"dpd_local\" } } ] } Next Steps Learn more about integrating with REACT: Retrieving Shipment and Event Data Updating Shipments Error Codes"

This page explains how to use metadata to group shipments together, how to view shipment groups in the REACT UI, and how to present grouped shipments to your customers using REACT's tracking pages. Shipment Groups Overview In REACT, a shipment is a singly-tracked consignment of goods that are being shipped together from a single origin location to a single destination location. Shipment groups enable you to link related shipments together so that they can be tracked through the same page. For example, suppose that a clothing retailer has received an order for a coat and a hat. At the time of order, the two items are physically located in two different warehouses. This means that they will need to be sent as two separate shipments, as all items on a shipment must share an origin location. However, both items are still a single order from the customer's perspective. As such, it would be a better user experience to provide the customer with a single link that they could use to track both shipments, rather than two separate links. By using shipment groups, you can link these two shipments together via a shared metadata property, enabling you to send tracking details for both as a single link. The page displayed by the link displays tracking information for all shipments tagged with that property, with a drop-down menu enabling customers to switch between all shipments in the group without navigating to a separate page. Registering Grouped Shipments Shipment groups are based on metadata. If two shipments share an identical metadata property (that is, one that has both the same key and value ), then REACT considers them to be grouped together. When grouping REACT shipments, the metadata key is the grouping (that is, the category by which shipments are grouped together) and the metadata value is effectively the name of the group itself. For example, an organisation grouping shipments by order number might use orderID (or similar) as a metadata key and their own order number as the value . The following example shows a request to register four simple shipments at once. The shipments all have a metadata key named group_name denoting the group they are in. The first two shipments belong to example_group1 , and the second two below to example_group2 . Shipment Groups Example { \"shipments\": [ { \"tracking_references\": [ \"shipment1\" ], \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"group_id\", \"value\": \"example_group1\", \"type\": \"String\" } ] }, { \"tracking_references\": [ \"shipment2\" ], \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"group_id\", \"value\": \"example_group1\", \"type\": \"String\" } ] }, { \"tracking_references\": [ \"shipment3\" ], \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"group_id\", \"value\": \"example_group2\", \"type\": \"String\" } ] }, { \"tracking_references\": [ \"shipment4\" ], \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"group_id\", \"value\": \"example_group2\", \"type\": \"String\" } ] } ] } To add a pre-existing shipment to a group, use the Update Shipment endpoint to add the relevant metadata property to the shipment. Note that REACT's Update Shipment endpoint requires you to pass an entire new shipment object, which overwrites the existing shipment resource. As such, you would need to pass all of the shipment's current details as well as the metadata property when adding a shipment to a group. Note For more information on registering REACT shipments, see the Registering Shipments page. For more information on updating REACT shipments, see the Updating Shipments page. Tracking Grouped Shipments Your customers can view tracking information for any shipment group by visiting https://react.sorted.com/tracking/[page_title]?customer_id=[customer_id_here]&metadata_key=[metadata_key_here]&metadata_value=[metadata_value_here] , where [page_title] is the title of your tracking page, [customer_id_here] is your REACT customer ID, [metadata_key_here] is the relevant grouping key and [metadata_value_here] is the value that you grouped the shipments together on. As an example, suppose that a customer with a customer_id of cs_1234567890 created a tracking page called examplePage and wanted to use it to let a customer view the first two shipments from the code sample given in the previous section. To do so, they would share the following link: https://react.sorted.com/tracking/examplePage?customer_id=cs_1234567890&metadata_key=group_id&metadata_value=example_group1 Shipment group tracking pages have a drop-down picker on the tracking widget that enables the customer to select which shipment's tracking information they want to view. The page also displays the key and value that the shipments are grouped by, and the number of shipments in the group. For non-autoloading shipment groupings REACT only displays the drop-down shipment picker and grouping information if you access the shipment via the shipment group link (that is, you use the shared metadata key and value to identify the shipments to be displayed). You can still use other valid tracking page link formats to view a shipment that is in a non-autoloading grouping (such as shipment_id or tracking_reference ), but REACT does not display links to other shipments in the group in this case. However, for shipments in an auto-loading shipment grouping, REACT always displays links to other shipments in the grouping, even if you track the individual shipments by their shipment_id or tracking_reference . Note For more information on using auto-loading groupings, see the Auto-Loading Shipments section. For more information on creating and distributing REACT tracking pages, see the Tracking Pages page. Creating Shipment Groupings The Configure Shipment Groupings UI page enables you to specify a name for up to three of the metadata keys that you use for your shipment groupings. For example, you might group shipments by a key called orderID . The Configure Shipment Groupings page enables you to specify a name such as Order Reference (or similar) for that grouping, which REACT would then display on the group tracking page instead of the orderID key name. To name a shipment group: Select Settings > Shipment Groupings to display the Configure Shipment Groupings UI page. Enter the Metakey of the group you want to name. Enter the Name you want to give to the group. Use the AutoLoad toggle to select whether you want REACT to automatically search for grouped shipments. For more information on auto-loading shipments, see the Auto-Loading Shipments section. Note You can only specify one of your group keys as an autoload key. If you select the AutoLoad toggle for a particular key, then PRO deselectes it for any other keys. Add up to two more keys and names, if required. Click Save to save your changes. To edit your existing group names, click the Edit button. Auto-Loading Shipments If you set a key to auto-load, then REACT automatically performs a lookup to obtain further shipments that have the same key and value when it receives a shipment that contains the specified key. To put it another way, REACT actively groups shipments with an auto-loading metadata key together. This means that when you track an individual shipment with an auto-load key through REACT's tracking pages (for example, by shipment_id , tracking_reference , or custom_reference ), the system is able to see that the shipment has related shipments and can display a link to their details on the tracking page. This is different to regular \"passive\" shipment groupings, in which REACT does not actively search for additional shipments and does not display grouped shipment details on the tracking page if you track an individual shipment. For non-autoloading groupings, the only way to see grouped shipments on the REACT tracking page is by searching for them using shared metadata key / value parameters, as explained in the Tracking Grouped Shipments section. Auto-Loading Shipments Example As an example, you might specify an auto-load key for multi-package shipments originating from PRO. When REACT receives shipments from PRO, it registers one shipment per PRO package. By using an auto-loading key, REACT can automatically obtain, register, and group all of the packages in a PRO shipment as soon as it receives the first package. One way to do this would be to append PRO's shipment_id property to each shipment as a metadata key/value at the point of registration in REACT, as all packages from a PRO shipment would share a common PRO shipment_id . The code sample below shows two simplified Register Shipment requests with a PRO shipment_id appended as metadata via a key called PRO_Shipment_Id . Note that these shipments have the same metadata key but individual tracking references. Shipment 1 Shipment 2 { \"shipments\": [ { \"tracking_references\": [ \"AutoLoadExamples1\" ], \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"PRO_Shipment_Id\", \"value\": \"sp_01114749695851729329506736537600\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } ] } { \"shipments\": [ { \"tracking_references\": [ \"AutoLoadExamples2\" ], \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"PRO_Shipment_Id\", \"value\": \"sp_01114749695851729329506736537600\", \"type\": \"string\" } ] } ] } You would then need to set that metadata key as an auto-loading grouping in the REACT UI. Now, if you track one of the shipments by its tracking_reference in a REACT tracking page, then REACT automatically recognises that the shipment has a related shipment and offers a drop-down picker at the top of the page to enable you to switch between shipments. Searching For Grouped Shipments You can search for grouped shipments using your named shipment groupings (that is, those shipments that are grouped using the metadata keys configured on the Configure Shipment Groupings UI page) via the search bar in the REACT UI. To do so: From any page of the REACT UI, click the drop-down menu on the search bar and select the name of the grouping (i.e. the metadata key) you want to search by Enter the group name (i.e. the metadata value) and press Enter to display tabbed details of all the shipments in the group. REACT only displays tabs if you search for shipments by their grouping. If you were to search for the shipment in the example above by its tracking reference, for example, then REACT would only display that shipment's details.

This page explains how REACT webhooks work, how you can control them using shipment filters, and how to set webhooks and shipment filters up in the UI. What is a Webhook? A webhook is an automated message sent by an app whenever a particular event occurs. The principle is fairly simple: you tell the app where to send the data (i.e. the URL it should send to) and when to send (i.e. the circumstances in which you want to receive data). Whenever those circumstances occur, the webhook sends its payload to the location you specified. You can then use that data in whatever way you need. The key is that the webhook sends data to you proactively - you don't need to make a request like you would with a \"regular\" API. This enables you to build efficient services that don't need to continually poll an app for changes in order to stay up to date. Webhooks in REACT In REACT, webhooks are used a means of keeping you up to date with registered shipments. They are triggered either by changes in shipment state, or by calculated events (i.e. when REACT detects that a shipment may be missing or is late). When a shipment enters a pre-selected state, REACT sends the current details of the shipment and the event that caused it to change state to a pre-configured location. These timely updates mean that you can automate processes such as customer communications and carrier escalations. For example, you might set up a webhook that sends data whenever a shipment enters a state of Delayed . You could then feed the data from that webhook into your SMS gateway so that your customers are immediately alerted by text when delays occur. Webhook Payload When a shipment state change triggers a webhook, the webhook sends the Shipment Events resource for the event that caused that shipment state change in its payload body. The data sent has the same structure as the response from the Get Shipment Events API. Note For full reference details of the Shipment Events resource, click here . The Shipment Events resource has two main parts: shipment - This object contains a summary of the data REACT holds on the shipment in question, including reference numbers, carrier information and expected dates. events - This object contains details of the event that triggered the relevant shipment state change, including timestamps and a list of the properties that were changed as a result of the event. It's worth paying particular attention to the property_summary array within the events object. This array lists any changes to the shipment.shipment_state.state , shipment.delivered_date , shipment.promised_date , and shipment.shipped_date properties that occurred as a result of the event that triggered the webhook, including what each property was changed to and what it was set to previously. The richness of the data returned by the Shipment Events resource will depend to some extent on the data that was provided when the shipment in question was registered. If a webhook returns a shipment that was registered with just a carrier tracking reference, then the resource will only contain event details and that carrier tracking reference. However, if a webhook returns a shipment that was registered with additional details (such as custom references and promised dates) then these details will be sent as part of the webhook's payload, enabling you to build services that use this information without having to look it up elsewhere. Webhooks and Shipment Filters Each REACT webhook must be associated with at least one shipment filter. A shipment filter is a set of shipment conditions that is used as a webhook trigger. When a tracking event causes a shipment to change state so that it meets the criteria set out for a particular shipment filter, any webhooks that are associated with that filter will send their data. Note All REACT shipments have a current shipment state, which is updated as shipment events occur. For a full list of REACT shipment states, see the Shipment States page. You can use changes in shipment state and new calculated events to filter shipments. States and calculated events can be filtered in whatever way you choose. For example, you could set up a filter containing states that require escalation to the carrier, such as Lost , Damaged , and the Late calculated event. You could also set up a filter containing states that you would want to send delivery updates to your customers on, such as Out For Delivery , Collection Reminder , and Delivery Attempted . The Example Configuration section gives further examples of potential shipment filters. In REACT, each shipment filter can trigger multiple webhooks, and each webhook can be triggered by multiple filters. This many-to-many relationship enables you to create flexible configurations that don't tie your business processes into your webhook configurations. Managing Your Shipment Filters Shipment filters are managed in the REACT UI via the Settings > Shipment Filters page. This page enables you to set up new filters and edit or remove existing ones. It displays a card for each shipment filter that you set up. You'll need to set up your filters before configuring webhooks, as selecting shipment filters is part of the webhook configuration process. Creating New Shipment Filters Log into the REACT UI and select Settings > Shipment Filters to display the Create & Manage Shipment Filters page. Click the Create New Shipment Filter tile to begin creating a new filter. The Shipment Filter Name tile is displayed. Tip Filter names should be related to the business process you want to drive with the filter rather than the communication method you want to use with the customer. For example, \"Contact Required\" would be a better choice of filter name than \"SMS\". Give your filter a name and click Next to display a list of available carriers. Select the carriers that you want to add to the filter. If you do not select any carriers then the filter will trigger for shipments with all carriers. Click Next to display a list of available shipment states. Select the shipment states and calculated events you want to add to the filter. You can select calculated events can be selected from the Calculated Events tab. When you've selected everything you need, click Next . A list of the states and calculated events you selected is displayed. You can deselect states from this tile if you need to. When you're happy with the states and events in the filter, click Next to display a list of shipment types. Select the shipment types you want to include and then click Next to display the Add Shipment Tags tile. If required, add shipment tags by entering a tag name and clicking the plus button. If you select tags then only shipments that are tagged with at least one of those tags can trigger webhooks via your filter. Note You can add tags to shipments via the Register Shipments and Update Shipments endpoints. For more information on adding tags to shipments, see the Registering Extra Shipment Information section of the Registering Shipments page, and the Updating Shipments page. When you have added any tags you need, click Create Filter to finish. Your new filter appears as a tile on the Shipment Filters page. Editing Existing Shipment Filters To edit an existing shipment filter, click the Edit button on that filter's tile. The process of editing an existing filter is the same as that used to set up a new one. To delete an existing shipment filter, click the Delete button on that filter's tile and click Confirm on the pop-up confirmation dialog. You cannot delete a shipment filter if it is currently being used by one or more webhooks. User Access Admin and Marketing users can view, edit and delete shipment filters. Dashboard users do not have access to this feature. Managing Your Webhooks Webhooks are managed in the REACT UI via the Settings > Webhooks page. This page enables you to set up new webhooks and edit or remove existing ones. It displays a card for each webhook that you set up. Creating New Webhooks Log into the REACT UI and select Settings > Webhooks to display the Create Webhooks page. Click the Create New Webhook tile to begin creating a new webhook. The Name Your Webhook tile is displayed. Give your webhook a name and click Next to select shipment filters. Tip If you haven't set the required shipment filters up yet, click the Create Shipment Filter link to jump to the filter creation process. You will lose any unsaved configuration for your webhook. Select the shipment filter(s) that you want to trigger your webhook and click Next to select shipping state label languages. In order to receive shipment state labels in a language other than English (Great Britain) , you'll need to have configured custom shipping state labels in that language via the Settings > Shipment State Labels page. Select the language you want to receive shipment state labels in. The default is English (Great Britain) . Click Next to set up authentication. Select the authentication method for the service you want the webhook to send its data to. REACT supports outbound authentication via API Key , Basic authentication and JSON Web Token (JWT) : API Key - Select the API Key tab and enter the Request header and API key value that the webhook should authenticate with. The webhook will send this key-value pair every time it sends data. Basic - Select the Basic authentication tab and enter the Username and Password that the webhook should use. The webhook will authenticate with these details every time it sends data. JWT - To set up JWT webhook authentication, you'll need to be running a service that can create JWT tokens and pass them back to REACT. When you configure JWT authentication in REACT, you specify the details of that service and tell REACT where in the webhook data it should place the token it receives. The setup process is as follows: Select the JWT tab to display the JWT configuration fields. Enter the URL of the service REACT should make the JWT request to. Enter any JSON that REACT will need to include in the body of the request into the JSON Request Body field. For example, if your JWT service requires callers to supply a username and password in the body of the request, you could enter the following into this field: Example JWT JSON Request Body ```json { \"username\": \"EXAMPLE_USERNAME\", \"password\": \"EXAMPLE_PASSWORD\" } ``` Enter the HTTP Method that REACT should use when requesting the token. Enter the header that the webhook should send the resulting JWT token in into the Request Header field. Enter the value mask that REACT should use when sending the resulting token into the Value Mask Format field. The token itself should be represented as $JWT$ . Note The Request Header and Value Mask Format fields enable you to specify exactly how REACT should use the token it receives from your authentication service. When a JWT-authenticated webhook sends data it places the token inside the header key specified. The corresponding value for this header key is the contents of the Value Mask Format field, where $JWT$ represents the token itself. For example, if you wanted REACT to send the token in a header named Authentication , with a corresponding key of Bearer (token) , you would enter: Request Header: Authentication Value Mask: Bearer $JWT$ Enter any headers that REACT should use when requesting the token by entering a Key and Value and clicking the Add button. Click Next to finish setting up authentication. Note Your JWT service should be configured to return JWT tokens in the following format: {\"access_token\": \"[jwt-here]\"} . REACT cannot accept tokens in alternative formats. When you have entered your authentication details, click Next to set up headers. If required, enter any headers you want the webhook to include in the data it sends to you by entering their Key and Value and clicking Add . Adding headers is optional. You can add multiple headers if you need to. When you've added any headers you need, click Next to set up your webhook URL. Enter the Request URL you want the webhook to send its payload to and select whether you want it to use a POST or PUT HTTP method when sending data to your service. If you need to, click Send Test Webhook to test your webhook configuration. The panel on the card shows what the payload will look like. Caution You should enter your Request URL details carefully, as REACT doesn't attempt to re-send data in cases where a webhook could not be received. When you're happy with your setup, click Create to create the webhook. Your new webhook appears as a tile on the Webhooks page. Editing Existing Webhooks To edit an existing webhook, click the Edit button on the webhook's tile. The process of editing an existing webhook is the same as that used to set up a new one. To deactivate and reactivate a webhook, click the Active / Inactive toggle on the webhook's tile. Deactivating a webhook means that it will not send data even if a shipment meet the criteria set out in an associated shipment filter. To delete an existing webhook, click the Delete button on the webhook's tile and click Confirm on the pop-up confirmation dialog. Viewing Webhook Logs The Webhook Logs page enables you to view details of each time that a particular webhook has been triggered. This information could help you to better understand how your webhooks are being used, or to troubleshoot potential problems. To view the Webhook Logs page for a webhook, click the webhook's tile on the Settings > Webhooks page, or navigate to https://app.sorted.com/settings/webhooks/wh_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/logs , where wh_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is the unique ID of the webhook you want to view details for. The Webhook Logs page displays a list of all events for the selected webhook, including the following information: The Code of the response to the webhook's payload (that is, whether the data sent by the webhook was received and recognised as valid by the destination service, or an error message was returned). The URL that the request was sent to. The Elapsed Time between the webhook being triggered and a response being received. The Date and time that the webhook was triggered. To filter the list of webhook events, click the Add Filters drop-down. You can filter either by the Date that the webhook request was sent, or by Status (that is, whether the webhook request was successful or returned an error). To view further information on a particular webhook event, select it from the list. REACT displays the Request Details page. The Request Details page displays the following information for the selected request: The URL that the request was sent to. The Elapsed Time between the webhook being triggered and a response being received. The Date and time that the webhook was triggered. The Request Headers sent. For information on configuring the headers that your webhooks send, see steps 6-8 of the Creating New Webhooks process. The Request Body sent. For more information on the information sent in the body of REACT webhooks, see the Webhook Payload section. The Response Headers and Response Body received (where applicable). User Access Admin users can view, edit and delete webhooks. Marketing users can view existing webhooks but not edit configuration. Dashboard users do not have access to this feature. Example Configuration This section gives a simplified example of how webhooks and shipment filters can be linked. Suppose you want to set up the following business processes: If a shipment is In Transit , Delivered , or has a Collection Reminder available, send an SMS update to the customer. You could put these states in a shipment filter called Updates . If a shipment has a Final Collection Reminder available, or is in a state of Action Required , send SMS and email updates to the customer. You could put these states in a shipment filter called Action Required . If a shipment has a Proof of Delivery available, send an email to the customer. You could put this state in a shipment filter called For Reference . If a shipment is Delayed or has had a calculated event, send an SMS update to the customer and escalate to the carrier. You could put this state in a shipment filter called Escalate and Update . If a shipment is Damaged or Destroyed , escalate to the carrier without initially sending an SMS to the customer. You could put these states in a shipment filter called Escalate . You could then set the following webhooks up: One that sends data to your SMS gateway to trigger text shipment state updates to your customers. One that sends data to your Email gateway to trigger email shipment state updates to your customers. One that sends data to your CRM, from where it is used to generate escalation cases with your carriers. During the webhook setup process, you would link the webhooks to the shipment filters as follows: Note that the shipment filters are based around business processes, and the webhooks are based around the services you want REACT to communicate with. This means that if you want to, say, change the Updates filter so that it sends out Whatsapp messages instead of SMS, you could use your existing filter with a new webhook. Equally, if you wanted to use email updates with a new shipment filter, you could simply create the filter and add it to the existing Email webhook. However, this is only a suggested workflow. REACT enables you to combine shipment filters and webhooks in whatever way you feel is best for your business. Tip If you use webhooks to set up automated customer communications, consider asking your carrier to disable any automated tracking updates they may send to customers. Otherwise, customers might receive duplicate communications. Next Steps Learn more about the REACT UI: Monitoring Shipments Settings User Management"

This page explains how to use REACT's States , Calculated Events , and All Shipments dashboards to get timely information on how your shipments are progressing, and to spot potential problems. Viewing an Overview of Your Shipments The States dashboard gives you an overview of your current shipments. It indicates how many shipments you have in each particular shipment state, how many shipments are in exception states, and how many shipments you have in each geographical region. To open the States dashboard, select the Dashboards > States menu option. The States dashboard uses shipment states to group shipments into red/amber/green categories, helping you to identify individual shipments that may require attention. Shipment states are colour-coded into the following: Red (Critical Exceptions) - There is an issue with the shipment that cannot be resolved until you take action, or the shipment has been destroyed or lost. For example, a shipment in a state of Action Required would be classified as red. Amber (Other Exceptions) - There is an issue with the shipment that does not require you to take action. However, you might want to notify your customers. For example, a shipment in a state of Delivery failed would be classified as amber. Green (All Good) - There is no issue with the shipment. For example, a shipment in a state of Dispatched would be classified as green. For a full list of REACT shipment states, including their colour classification, see the Shipment States page. The States dashboard has two sections: a map indicating the delivery locations of your shipments and a row of tiles indicating how many of your shipments are in each colour status. You can select whether or not the map is displayed using the Show / Hide Map toggle. Note Only those shipments for which REACT holds an origin address are displayed on the map. For more information on registering shipment data, see the Registering Extra Shipment Information section of the Registering Shipments page. If required, you can filter the data displayed using the filter controls explained in the Filtering Dashboard Data section. Drilling Down on Shipment Details by Status To view how many shipments you have in each shipment state: Click the View button on the relevant colour tile. For example, to view how many shipments you had in each red shipment state, you would click View on the Critical Exceptions tile. REACT displays tiles indicating how many shipments you have in each state for the selected colour. To view a list of all the shipments in a particular state, click View on that state's tile. REACT opens the All Shipments dashboard, filtered to display the relevant information. Drilling Down on Shipment Details by Location To view a list of all shipments that are currently in a particular geographical location, click a point on the map. REACT opens the All Shipments dashboard, filtered to display the relevant information. Exporting Shipment Details to CSV There are several points on the States dashboard from which you can export shipment details to CSV: To export details of all shipments, click Export on the All shipments tile. To export details of all shipments in a particular colour status, click Export on the relevant colour tile. To export details of all shipments in a particular state, click View on the relevant colour tile and then click Export on the required shipment state tile. Alternatively, the Download button on the map enables you to export whatever data you care currently viewing, including any colour categories you may have selected and filters you may have applied. For example, if you click View on the red Critical Exceptions tile and then click the Download button, then REACT exports a CSV file containing all shipments in red statuses. If you were to then apply a filter so that only shipments with a Promised Date of tomorrow were displayed, and then click the Download button again, then REACT would export a CSV file containing a list of those red shipments that had a Promised Date of tomorrow. Viewing Calculated Events The Calculated Events dashboard displays the number of your shipments that REACT has flagged as Late or May Be Missing . To open the Calculated Events dashboard, select the Dashboards > Calculated Events menu option. Click View on a particular event tile to open a list of shipments that have been flagged with that calculated event in the All Shipments dashboard, or click Export to export that list to a CSV file. Alternatively, click a location on the map to open a list of shipments originating from that location that have been flagged as either Late or May Be Missing in the All Shipments dashboard. Note A calculated event is an event that is generated by REACT's internal processing, rather than as a result of an external tracking update. For more information on how calculated events work in REACT, see the Calculated Events page. Cached Shipment Data To maximise performance, REACT caches data on the States and Calculated Events dashboards for ten minutes. If you make a particular request (say, clicking the View button on the Critical Exceptions tile to view how many of your shipments are in each individual red state), and then make an identical request within ten minutes, then REACT displays the cached data it received from the first request rather than making a separate database call. As such, you should bear in mind that the new request will not show any changes that have occurred since the first request was made. If you make a different request, or if you make the same request more than ten minutes after the first request was made, then REACT refreshes the data. This caching takes place at an organisational level, rather than a user level. For example, suppose than User A makes a particular request, and then User B makes the same request five minutes later. In this scenario, User B would receive the cached data from user A's request. However, if User B was to make the same request fifteen minutes later, then REACT would obtain new data. Viewing Individual Shipments The All Shipments dashboard gives you a list of all your individual shipments, and enables you to click through to view shipment event data. To open the All Shipments dashboard, select the Dashboards > All Shipments menu option, or click View on the All Shipments tile. The All Shipments dashboard displays a list of all your current shipments. You can filter the list using the filter controls explained in the Filtering Dashboard Data section. To export the data displayed onscreen (including any filters you may have selected), click Export CSV . Select a shipment record to view a summary of the registration and tracking information held on that shipment. Adding Shipment Notes To add a note to a shipment, select that shipment, click Add Note , add your message in the text box, and then click Save . Shipment notes are grouped by date. To view notes for a particular date, click the + button next to that date in the Notes panel. Adding shipment notes can help you to manage exceptions and customer service enquiries, enabling you to record any action or communication that has taken place for that specific shipment. Tip The shipment information displayed in the REACT UI is largely populated from the information provided at registration. The more information you provide at registration, the more useful this page will be. For more information on the information you can provide at registration, see the Registering Shipments page. Searching For a Specific Shipment All of REACT's UI pages display a search bar at the top. To view a specific shipment's details: Select the parameter you want to search by from the drop-down menu. REACT enables you to search by Tracking Reference , Custom Reference , or by one of your named shipment groupings. Note For more information on REACT shipment groups, see the Grouping Shipments page. Enter a search value and click the search icon or press Enter to search on the relevant shipment details. If REACT only finds one shipment matching your criteria, then it opens the Shipment page for that shipment. If REACT finds multiple shipments matching your criteria, then it opens the All Shipments page with all matching shipments listed. Filtering Dashboard Data REACT's dashboards enable you to filter the data displayed. Filtering can be particularly handy if you have large volumes of data to work with. You can filter data by Carriers , States , Shipment Origin , Shipment Destination , Order Date , Metadata , Registered Date , Shipped Date , Promised Date , Estimated Date , and Shipment Type . Note By default, REACT's dashboards only display those shipments created in the last 14 days. You can override this default filtration by adding your own date filters. To filter data: Click the Add Filters drop-down. The Filters panel is displayed. Select the filters you want to apply: The Carriers , States , Origins , and Destinations filters use a search page. To add these filters, click Add on the relevant tile to display a list of available options, then select the options you require from the list. You can select multiple options if required. Selected options are displayed in the right-hand column. To deselect an option, click on it. Note The Carriers list only displays those carriers for which you have an active carrier connector. To select dates and Shipment Type s, select the required option using the radio buttons. The Metadata filter enables you to specify a key / value pair. When filtering by metadata, REACT only displays information on shipments that contain the specified Key and Value as part of their data. Note For more information on using metadata in REACT, see the Registering Extra Shipment Information section of the Registering Shipments page. Click Apply and close to apply your changes and return to the dashboard. REACT will now display only those shipments that meet your criteria. Active filters appear on the Active Filters toolbar. To deselect a filter from the Active Filters toolbar, click the filter's x button. User Access All REACT users can view the States and All Shipments pages, and view, edit and delete shipment notes.

To configure notifications, you'll need to set up an account with one of REACT's compatible email or SMS providers, give REACT your account details, and configure the details of the notification itself. Notifications Overview The REACT notification centre has three components: Notification Connectors store the technical details REACT uses to send emails and SMS messages, including send-from addresses and account details for third party providers. All REACT notifications are powered by a notification connector. Notification Templates define the content of your notification. These can either be set up via a third-party provider, or (in the case of REACT and Postmark notifications) edited from within the REACT UI via the Notification Templates page. Notifications are the individual messages sent to customers. When you set up a notification, you define the connector that will power it, the template it should use, and define when the notification should be sent. Setting up Notification Connectors The first step in setting up REACT notifications is to create a notification connector. You can set up connectors for your existing Postmark (email), Twilio (SMS), and SendGrid (email) accounts. Alternatively, you can set up a REACT connector, which enables you to send emails without the need for a third-party service. Note Before you can set up a notification connector to a third-party service, you'll need to set up an account with the relevant provider and have your details to hand. This section explains the information you need to set up a connector to each of the providers. To set up a new connector, select Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors , scroll down to the All Notification Connectors , and click Connect on the connector you want to set up. See below for specific information on each provider. Once you have set a connector up, its tile moves to the Existing Connectors section of the Notification Connectors page. REACT REACT connectors enable you to send emails without the need for a third-party service. To set up a REACT connector: Select Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors and click Connect on the REACT Email Notifications connector. REACT displays the REACT Email Notifications Connection tile. Enter a Name for your connection. Enter the Email Address you want to send emails from. If you use an email associated with your own domain then you will need to verify that domain once the connector has been set up. Alternatively, you can use a @react.sorted.com address, which does not require domain verification. Enter the sender Display Name you want to use in your sent emails. Click Save to create the connector and return to the Notification Connectors page. Verifying Custom Domains If you entered an address from a custom domain into the Email Address field, then you will need to verify that domain before you can use the new connector. Verifying your domain enables REACT to confirm that you own the domain you want to send emails from. To verify your domain: Click the context menu on the tile and then click Verify . REACT displays the Domain Verification dialog. Make a note of the values in the DKIM Host and DKIM Text fields. Create a new TXT DNS record on your domain, where Name = DKIM Host and Value = DKIM Text. Note For information on creating TXT DNS records, see your domain host's documentation. In the REACT UI, click the Verify button to verify your domain. REACT checks the domain and indicates whether the domain was successfully verified. Note It may take up to 48 hours for the DNS record you created to become verifiable. You can Cancel the dialog and return to complete the verification later if required. Postmark Before you can set up a connector to Postmark, you'll need to do the following: Go the the Postmark site and set up an account. Add Sender Signatures or Verified Domains. In order to send emails via Postmark you'll need to have a Sender Signature set up for each email address you want to send from. Alternatively, you can verify all addresses in a particular domain by setting up a Verified Domain. Note For more information on setting up Sender Signatures, see this page of the Postmark documentation. For more information on setting up Verified Domains, see this page of the Postmark documentation. Set up Postmark email templates. Any templates you set up will automatically be made available to select when you set up notifications in REACT. Note For more information on configuring Postmark email templates, see Postmark's documentation Make a note of your Postmark server API token. You can view your server API token by logging in to Postmark and selecting Servers > [your server] > API Tokens . You're now ready to set up a Postmark connector. To do so: Select Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors and click Connect on the Postmark Email Notifications connector. REACT displays the Postmark Email Notifications Connection tile. Enter a Name for your connection. Enter the Server Token for your Postmark account. Enter the Email Address you want to send your email updates from. The address must either have a Sender Signature or be part of a Verified Domain. Click Save to create the connector. SendGrid Before you can set up a connector to SendGrid, you'll need to do the following: Go the the SendGrid site and set up an account. Verify your sender details. Note For more information on verifying your SendGrid sender details, see SendGrid's documentation Set up SendGrid email templates. Any templates you set up are automatically made available to select when you set up notifications in REACT. Note For more information on configuring SendGrid email templates, see SendGrid's documentation Set up a SendGrid API key with full access to the SendGrid service, and make a note of it. You'll need this information in order to set up a connector to SendGrid. Note You can only view your SendGrid API key immediately after creating it. For more information on setting up SendGrid API keys, see SendGrid's documentation You're now ready to set up a SendGrid connector. To do so: Select Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors and click Connect on the SendGrid Email Notifications connector. REACT displays the SendGrid Email Notifications Connection tile. Enter a Name for your connection. Enter the API Key for your SendGrid account. Enter the Email Address of your SendGrid account. Click Save to create the connector. Twilio Before you can set up a connector to Twilio, you'll need to do the following: Go to the Twilio site and sign up for an account. Create a Twilio messaging service. Note For more information on creating Twilio messaging services, see Twilio's documentation Make a note of your Twilio Account SID and Auth Token . Note For more information on obtaining your Twilio authentiication details, see Twilio's documentation You're now ready to set up a Twilio connector. To do so: Select Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors and click Connect on the Twilio SMS Notifications connector. REACT displays the Twilio SMS Notifications Connection tile. Enter a Name for your connection. Enter the Account SID and Auth Token for your Twilio account. Enter the Phone Number you want to send your SMS updates from. This must be a registered Twilio phone number. Click Save to create the connector. Managing Existing Connectors Editing Existing Notification Connectors To edit an existing notification connector, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors UI page and click Edit on the connector you want to edit. REACT displays the Edit Notification Connection page for that connector. Make the required edits and click Save to save your changes. Deactivating Existing Notification Connectors To deactivate an existing notification connector, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors UI page and click the Active toggle on the connector's tile. The toggle switches to the Inactive position, confirming that the connector has been deactivated. Deactivating a notification connector means that REACT can no longer retrieve data from that provider. However, its configuration is saved, and the connector can be reactivated by clicking the toggle again. Disconnecting Existing Notification Connectors To permanently disconnect a connector, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors UI page and click the Disconnect button on the connector's tile. A confirmation dialog is displayed. Click Yes to disconnect the connector. Disconnecting a notification connector deactivates it and deletes all of its configuration. To reinstate a disconnected notification connector you would need to set it up again as a new connector. Creating Notification Templates The Notification Templates page enables you to create HTML email templates to use with your REACT and Postmark connectors. Email templates define the content of the emails you send. You can add personalised customer details, such as names and tracking links, to your templates using merge tags. To create a new notification template: Open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Templates UI page and click Create New Template . The Create Template page is displayed. Enter a Name for the template. Names are used to identify the template in the REACT UI. Enter a Subject for the template. This is the subject line that the sent emails will use. Select the Notification Connector that the template is to be associated with. Enter your email content into the HTML dialog box. You can use standard HTML and internal CSS. Click Save to save your changes and return to the Notification Templates page. The template you set up is now displayed on the page. When you set up a notification using the connector you selected in Step 3, your template is available in the Select Email Template list. To preview your new template, click the option menu on the template's tile and select Preview . Use the buttons at the top of the page to choose between previewing your template in desktop and mobile views. Using Merge Tags Merge tags enable you to personalise the notifications sent out to customers. For example, you might want to insert a customer's name or address details into the text and email sent to them, rather than sending a generic message. A merge tag is a snippet of JSON that denotes the data that should be inserted into a notification, and where that data should be inserted. To use a merge tag, simply add the relevant field or fields to the text of your notification. For emails, you will need to do so in the relevant template (i.e. via the SendGrid / Postmark UI or the Notification Templates REACT UI page, as applicable). For SMS notifications, you would insert your merge tags into the REACT UI's Enter Text for SMS field. The full merge tag structure is: Example Merge Tag Address Structure Date Structure { \"Consumer\": { \"Reference\": \"Reference\", \"Email\": \"Email\", \"Phone\": \"Phone\", \"MobilePhone\": \"MobilePhone\", \"FirstName\": \"FirstName\", \"LastName\": \"LastName\", \"MiddleName\": \"MiddleName\", \"Title\": \"Title\" }, \"Carrier\": \"Carrier\", \"CarrierService\": \"CarrierService\", \"TrackingReference\": \"TrackingReference\", \"RetailerName\": \"RetailerName\", \"Signee\": \"Signee\", \"Addresses\": { \"From\": \"<See Address Structure tab>\", \"To\": \"<See Address Structure tab>\" }, \"PromisedDate\": { \"Start\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\", \"End\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\" }, \"ExpectedDeliveryDate\": { \"Start\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\", \"End\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\" }, \"DeliverySlotInterval\": { \"Start\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\", \"End\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\" }, \"ShippedDate\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\", \"OrderDate\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\", \"DeliveredDate\": \"<See Date Structure tab>\", \"TrackingPageUrl\": \"TrackingPageUrl\", \"Key1\": \"Value1\", \"Key2\": \"Value2\" } { \"PropertyName\": \"PropertyName\", \"PropertyNumber\": \"PropertyNumber\", \"AddressLine1\": \"AddressLine1\", \"AddressLine2\": \"AddressLine2\", \"AddressLine3\": \"AddressLine3\", \"Locality\": \"Locality\", \"Region\": \"Region\", \"PostalCode\": \"PostalCode\", \"CountryIsoCode\": \"CountryIsoCode\" } { \"Second\": \"14\", \"Minute\": \"32\", \"Hour\": \"21\", \"Day\": \"17\", \"Month\": \"2\", \"Year\": \"2020\", \"ShortDate\": \"15/06/2009\", \"GeneralDateShortTime\": \"24/11/2020 08:15\" } In practice, you would likely use merge tags one field at a time, rather than as a single JSON object. For example, you might enter the following example as notification text: Hi {{Consumer.FirstName}} ! Your package is on its way. To keep an eye on it, go to {{TrackingPageUrl}} . Note When configuring Twilio notifications, the TrackingPageUrl property only requires triple curly brackets, rather than the standard double curly brackets. For Twilio, you would need to enter the above example as: Hi {{Consumer.FirstName}} ! Your package is on its way. To keep an eye on it, go to {{{TrackingPageUrl}}} . The metadata keys at the bottom enable you to further customise the information available in your notifications by adding metadata from your shipments. For example, supposed that you register a shipment with a Contents metadata property, which you use to supply a description of the shipment contents, as follows: Example Metadata Property \"metadata\": [ { \"key\": \"Contents\", \"value\": \"Shoes\", \"type\": \"String\" }, ], You could then further enhance your notification by adding shipment contents to the text. For example: Hi {{Consumer.FirstName}} ! The package with your {{Contents}} in is on its way. To keep an eye on it, go to {{TrackingPageUrl}} . Tip Merge tags can only display information about a shipment if that shipment has the relevant information registered. In the example above, this would require you to register a customer's first name, and a Contents metadata property. For more information on registering shipment data, including setting up metadata, see the Registering Shipments page. Managing Existing Notification Templates Editing Existing Templates To edit an existing template, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Templates UI page and click Edit on the template you want to edit. REACT displays the Edit Template page. Make the required edits and click Save to save your changes. Deleting Templates To delete a template, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Templates UI page, click the option menu on the relevant template, and click Delete . REACT displays a confirmation dialog. Click Yes to delete the template. Creating Notifications Once you've created your notification connectors, you're ready to configure your notifications themselves. When you create a notification, you tell REACT what connector you'd like to use, when REACT should send the notification, and what the content of the notification should be. If required, you can also include a link to a REACT tracking page within the notification. REACT notifications are triggered by shipment filters. Each shipment filter contains a list of shipment states and calculated events. When a shipment enters once of the filter's states or events, REACT sends any notifications using that filter as a trigger. For example, suppose that you want to send an SMS notification to your customers when their shipment is out for delivery but appears to be late. To do this, you would set up a shipment filter with the Out For Delivery state and Late calculated event selected, and then create a Twilio notification with that filter selected as the notification's trigger. To create a new notification: Select Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up to display the Notification Set Up page. Click the Add New Communication tile. REACT displays a list of available connectors. Select the connector you want to use for the notification, and then click Next to display editable fields relating to notification details. Enter a Name for the notification. Select the Shipment Filter that you want to use as a trigger for the notification. Note If you have not yet created the shipment filter you want to use, click Create Shipment Filter . REACT redirects you to the Create & Manage Shipment Filters page. When you have set your shipment filter up, return to the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up page to configure your notification. Enter your notification content. This step differs depending on whether you are setting up SMS or email notifications: If you are setting up email notifications, select the email template you want to use from the Select Email Template drop-down list. Note For REACT notifications, this list displays the templates you have configured for the selected connector on the Notification Templates UI page. For SendGrid notifications, the list is automatically populated using the templates you have set up in SendGrid. For Postmark notifications, the list displays both templates configured in Postmark and templates configured in the REACT UI. If you are setting up Twilio SMS notifications, enter the text of your SMS into the Enter Text for SMS field. Note Merge tags enable you to inject specific customer details such as names and addresses into your notifications. For more information on merge tags, see the Using Merge Tags section. If required, select a REACT tracking page from the Select Tracking Page drop-down list. If you select a tracking page, then REACT will insert a tracking link into the notification. Note For more information on setting up REACT tracking pages, see the Creating Tracking Pages page. If you want to activate the notification immediately after saving, select the Activate This Notification check box. If you want to save the notification without activating it, leave the Activate This Notification check box unselected. Click Save to save the notification. Managing Existing Notifications Editing Existing Notifications To edit an existing notification, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up UI page and click Edit on the notification you want to edit. REACT displays the Edit Notification page for that notification. Make the required edits and click Save to save your changes. Deactivating Existing Notifications To deactivate an existing notification, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up UI page and click the Active toggle on the notification's tile. The toggle switches to the Inactive position, confirming that the notification has been deactivated. Deactivating a notification means that REACT will no longer send it, even if shipments meet the criteria set out in its shipment filter. However, its configuration is saved, and the notification can be reactivated by clicking the toggle again. Disconnecting Existing Notifications To permanently disconnect a notification, open the Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up UI page and click the Disconnect button on the notification's tile. A confirmation dialog is displayed. Click Yes to disconnect the notification. Disconnecting a notification deactivates it and deletes all of its configuration. To reinstate a disconnected notification you would need to set it up again.

Here you'll find a brief overview of REACT's component parts and what you can do with them. If you just want to get started with the system, check out the Quick Start guide. Introduction to REACT REACT aggregates all your tracking information in one place and one format, no matter where your shipments are going or what carrier they're shipping with. Once you register your shipments and give REACT permission to access tracking data from your carriers, REACT automatically watches out for updates and keeps all your shipment records up to date. This standardised tracking data enables you to build API-driven tracking pages on your sites, use webhooks to set up automated delivery alerts to your consumers or customer service teams, and monitor shipment performance via REACT's UI dashboard. How REACT Works REACT is based around three fundamental concepts: shipments, tracking events, and events. A shipment is a singly-tracked consignment of goods that are being shipped together from a single origin location to a single destination location. A tracking event is a shipment progress update received from a carrier. REACT converts carrier updates into a standard form, meaning that tracking events are always consistent no matter which carrier you ship with. A REACT event gives details of a shipment property change. For example, an address change to a particular shipment would be represented as an event. Events can be triggered by tracking events. The Shipment Lifecycle A typical REACT shipment lifecycle might look something like this: A shipment is registered for tracking in REACT. You can register shipments via either the Register Shipments API endpoint or REACT's SFTP upload service. Note For more information on registering shipments, see the Registering Shipments page. REACT continually checks its carrier data for new tracking events relating to the shipment. You'll need to set up carrier connectors via the Settings > Carrier Connectors UI page to give REACT access to your tracking information. Where REACT finds new tracking information, it analyses the tracking event sent by the carrier and uses it to determine the shipment's current state. REACT uses internal, standardised shipment states for all carriers. For example, our analysis has shown that DPD UK’s tracking events with a status of Collected and Yodel tracking events with a status of Parcel Picked Up mean the same thing. As such, REACT converts both of these statuses to an internal REACT shipment state of Collected By Carrier , making it easier to track and manage your shipments no matter which carrier they're with. This process takes place for every tracking event received from REACT's supported carriers. You can also customise the names used for REACT shipment states via the UI’s Settings > Custom State Labels page. For example. you could rename the Collected By Carrier REACT shipment state to With Our Providers . State labels enable you to communicate tracking information to your customers in your brand's tone of voice or in an alternative language. REACT state labels support up to 8 locales. Note For a full list of available REACT shipment states, see the Shipment States page. REACT converts the contents of the carrier's tracking update into a standardised REACT tracking event, and associates the contents of that event with the relevant shipment, based on the shipment's carrier tracking reference. If two or more shipments have the same carrier tracking reference, then REACT associates the tracking event with all relevant shipments. Note For information on the structure of REACT's tracking events, see the Get Tracking Events API reference. If a shipment's properties need to be updated as a result of the tracking event (for example, because the shipment's state or promised date have changed), then REACT creates an internal event and updates the shipment's details accordingly. Note For more information on the structure of REACT's Event objects, see the Get Event API reference. If the change in shipment properties has triggered any of your webhooks (for example, because you have a webhook set up to listen out for failed deliveries and the shipment's state has changed to Delivery Failed Card Left ), then REACT sends the shipment's data to you. Note For more information on setting up webhooks, see the Managing Webhooks page. You can use the webhook data REACT sends to drive services that send automated email, SMS, push, or social media notifications to your customers. You can also use REACT's webhook data to build services that automatically escalate issues to your carriers or create tickets for your customer service team to manage. You can use the data from REACT's APIs to drive embedded delivery tracking from your own website, without the need to pass customers off to a carrier portal. Note For more information on retrieving tracking data from REACT, see the Retrieving Shipment and Event Data page. REACT Components REACT is designed to be flexible, enabling you to manage and track shipments in a variety of ways. You can interact with REACT via: APIs - REACT's APIs let you register and maintain your shipment data, and retrieve tracking information. Webhooks - REACT uses webhooks to notify you of shipping events proactively. Whenever a shipment enters a selected state, REACT will send that shipment's data to you. UI - The REACT dashboard gives you advanced shipment monitoring features, and enables administrators to configure the system. SFTP - If required, you can upload shipment details to REACT via file transfer instead of the API. Integrating with REACT REACT offers the following API endpoints, enabling you to offer advanced shipment tracking and management features through your own website or apps: Endpoint Purpose Register Shipments Register shipments for tracking Get Shipment by Shipment ID Retrieve shipment details by REACT Shipment ID Get Shipments Retrieve shipment details by tracking or custom reference Update Shipment Update shipment details Delete Shipment Delete a shipment Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID Retrieve all shipment tracking events for a specified shipment Get Event Retrieve events by REACT Event ID Get Shipment Events Retrieve events by date range, references and carrier Get Shipment Events by Shipment ID Retrieve event details by REACT Shipment ID Get Shipment States History Retrieve a shipment's shipment state history To query any of the APIs, you'll need an API key. You can create one from the Settings > API Keys tab in the REACT UI. You'll also need to make sure your accept and content-type headers are set to application/json , as REACT only works with JSON data. Note For full request and response details for each endpoint, see the API Reference . For information on how to register shipment details via API and SFTP, see the Registering Shipments page. For information on retrieving shipment, event, and tracking information via API, see the Retrieving Shipment and Event Data page. For information on updating shipment details via API, see the Updating Shipments page. For information on the error codes that REACT's APIs can return, see the Error Codes page. Webhooks and Shipment Filters REACT's webhooks enable you to build services that respond to shipping events proactively. During the webhook setup process, you associate a particular webhook with a set of conditions. When an event puts a particular shipment into one of those conditions, REACT sends details of the event and its associated shipment to a URL of your choice. You can then feed this data into whatever application you choose. Webhooks can be configured from the Settings > Webhooks tab on the REACT Dashboard. The settings you select on this page depend on the service that is to receive the webhook data. You'll need to know: The URL to send the data to. Whether the webhook needs to send using a POST or PUT method. The authentication details for the service that will receive the webhook. Whether the request should use any additional headers. In REACT, webhooks are triggered by shipment filters. A shipment filter is a list of shipment states, tags, and calculated events that acts as a webhook trigger. When a shipment meets any of these criteria, any webhooks configured for that filter will deploy. Each webhook can be triggered by multiple shipment filters, and each shipment filter can be associated with multiple webhooks. You can create shipment filters from the Settings > Shipment Filters tab on the REACT Dashboard. Note For more information on creating and maintaining Shipment Filters and webhooks, see the Managing Webhooks page. UI The UI gives REACT admins an intuitive set of tools with which to monitor shipments and configure system operation. It has three main functions - Reporting , Configuration , and User Management . You can access the REACT UI here . Note The REACT UI is compatible with the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Reporting REACT's dashboards can be found under the UI's Dashboard tab. They give you a filterable overview of your registered shipments and system connectivity. Shipment States - Shows how many of your shipments are in red, amber, or green status at any given time, and enables you to plot those shipments on a map. Where required, you can drill down to view information on individual shipments or shipment states. Performance - Shows statistics on shipment performance by country. Note For more information on monitoring shipments in the UI, see the Monitoring Shipments page. Configuration The UI's Settings tab enables you to configure REACT to receive carrier tracking information, set up webhooks and API keys, and configure connectivity to third-party products. API Keys - Enables you to set up new API keys and revoke existing keys where required. Shipment State Labels - Enables you to set up custom labels for REACT shipment states. Setting up custom labels helps you to communicate shipment updates to your customers using your own brand tone of voice. Carrier Connectors - Enables you to manage your existing carrier connectors and set up new ones where required. When you set up a connector for a particular carrier, you give REACT permission to receive tracking events from that carrier on your behalf. Shipment Filters - Enables you to manage your existing shipment filters and set up new ones where required. Webhooks - Enables you to manage authentication and payload details for your existing webhooks, associate webhooks with shipment filters, and set up new webhooks where required. Note For more information on configuring REACT in the UI, see the Settings page. User Management Administrators can manage the REACT users in their team from the Add Member page, accessed from the user menu icon. From this screen, as an Administrator, you can: Add team members. You'll need to give a name and email address. Once you send the invite, REACT sends an email to the user containing a link that can be used to activate the account and set up a password. View details of existing REACT users in your team, as well as people you have invited but who have not yet signed up. Re-send invitation emails to pending users. Delete existing and pending users. Note For more information on managing users in the UI, see the User Management page.

This guide explains how to set up real-time shipment tracking and configure shipment state monitoring via webhooks. Setting up Tracking To track a shipment in REACT, you'll need to do the following: Register the shipment . Registering a shipment lets REACT monitor tracking events in real time and enables you to use APIs to get updates on the shipment's progress. Set up a carrier connector for each of the carriers you work with. Carrier connectors enable REACT to obtain tracking events. Get the shipment's details . You can track shipments using the Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID endpoint and the REACT UI. Registering a Shipment You can give REACT details of the shipments you want to register using the Register Shipments endpoint. Like all REACT APIs, you'll need to generate an API key before you can talk to it. Getting an API Key To generate a new API key: Log into your REACT Dashboard and select Settings > API Keys > Create New . Enter an identifying name for the key, then click Create . Copy your API key and save it somewhere safe. Caution It's really important that you make a note of your API key, as you can't come back and view it later. You can use your key by adding an x-api-key header to any requests you make. This lets REACT know who you are, and makes sure only authorised people and applications can get at your data. The next section gives an example of a request header with an API key in place. Using the Register Shipments Endpoint To register a shipment, send a POST request to the Register Shipments endpoint. As a minimum, you'll need to send the following information: The shipment's tracking reference. REACT will only accept one tracking_reference per shipment. JSON Content-Type and Accept headers. REACT works with JSON data. An x-api-key header with the API key you generated earlier as its value. The full HTTP request for your new shipment should look something like this: Register Shipments Request & Headers POST /react/shipments HTTPS/1.1 Host: api.sorted.com Accept: application/json Content-Type: application/json X-Api-Key: [your-api-key] { \"shipments\": [{ \"tracking_references\": [\"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE\"] }] } Once you've sent the request, REACT will return a 201 code and a Shipment Created response, which contains some useful information about the Shipment resource produced. Register Shipments Response { \"id\": \"sp_TRACKING-DEMO-ID\", \"message\": \"Shipment record 'sp_TRACKING-DEMO-ID' with tracking reference [\"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE\"] registered successfully.\", \"tracking_references\": [ \"TRACKING-DEMO-REFERENCE\" ], \"_links\": [ { \"href\": \"https://api.sorted.com/react/shipments/sp_TRACKING-DEMO-ID\", \"rel\": \"self\" } ] } The id is particularly important - this is a REACT-generated identifier for this shipment that can be used throughout REACT's APIs. Tip This example shows the simplest possible Register Shipments request - just a carrier tracking reference. The more data you give REACT when registering shipments, the more the system can do for you. You'll get much better information from webhooks and more flexible retrieval options, including the ability to track shipments via your own company reference. For a full list of the properties REACT accepts when creating a shipment, check the API Reference . For more information on registering shipments, see the Registering Shipments page. Setting up Carrier Connectors When you set up a carrier connector, you'll need to give REACT your tracking credentials for that carrier. To set up a carrier connector: Log into your REACT Dashboard and select Settings > Carrier Connectors to display the Carrier Connectors page. Select the carrier for which you want to set up a connector and follow the on-screen instructions to confirm your tracking details. The information required varies from carrier to carrier. Select the check box to give REACT permission to retrieve tracking information and click Save to finish configuring the connector. Once the connector is set up, REACT keeps you in the loop by automatically accessing tracking data for any registered shipments with that carrier. To enable and disable existing connectors, use the **Active toggle on the connector's tile. Getting Tracking Events Once you've registered your shipments, your customers will probably want to see how they're getting on. One way to track a shipment in REACT is via the Get Tracking Events by Shipment ID endpoint. Send a GET request to https://api.sorted.com/react/tracking/search?shipment_id={id} , where {id} is the shipment id you obtained when registering the shipment. Don't forget to include your API key . This endpoint returns a Shipment Tracking Events response, which includes an array of all the tracking events that have been logged for that shipment. You can embed this data into your website or app, enabling you to serve real-time tracking information to your customers without directing them away from your site. Note For more information on retrieving shipment and tracking data from REACT, see the Retrieving Shipment and Event Data page. Setting Up Webhooks You can use webhooks to build automated shipment state monitoring functions within REACT. For example, you might want to automatically email your customer if a shipment falls into a particular state. There are four steps to setting up webhooks. We covered the first two in the previous section. Register the shipments you want to monitor. Set your carrier connectors up. Use shipment filters to tell REACT which shipment states to trigger webhooks for. Configure the webhook headers and target details. In this example we'll use REACT to help build a service that sends an SMS to a customer when their shipment is delivered to a location other than their home address. We'll set REACT up so that every time a shipment falls into a state of Delivered to Neighbour , Delivered to Reception or Delivered to Safe Location , the system sends that shipment's event data to a URL you specified. You can then feed that data into your SMS gateway of choice. Configuring Shipment Filters A shipment filter is a list of shipment states, calculated states, and/or shipment tags that acts as a webhook trigger. When a shipment meets any of these criteria, any webhooks configured for that filter will deploy. In our example, we need to set up a shipment filter that includes the Delivered To Neighbour , Delivered to Reception and Delivered to Safe Location shipment states. To do that, you'll need to: Log into your REACT Dashboard, select Settings > Shipment Filters and click Create New . Give your filter a name and click Next to display list of available shipment states. Select the Delivered To Neighbour , Delivered to Reception and Delivered to Safe Location shipment states from the list and click Next . A list of the states you selected is displayed. Click Next to display a list of shipment types. Select Delivery (this example only really applies to shipments that are being sent to the customer directly) and click Next to select tags. We don't need to select any tags in this example. Click Create filter to finish creating your shipment filter. Whenever an outbound shipment assumes one of your selected states, it'll now fall into your new shipment filter. Configuring Webhooks Now we have a shipment filter set up, we just need a webhook for it to trigger. To set one up: Log into your REACT Dashboard, select Settings > Webhooks and click Create New . Give your webhook a name and click Next to select shipment filters. Select the shipment filter you created in the previous section and click Next to select shipping state label languages. Select the language you want to receive shipping state labels in. The default is English (Great Britain) . Click Next to set up authentication. Select the authentication method for the service you want the webhook to talk to (REACT currently supports Basic Auth, API Keys and JWT), and enter the relevant authentication details. Click Next to set up header details. Enter any headers you want to append to the webhook payload by entering their Key and Value and clicking Add . When you've added any required headers, click Next to set up your webhook URL. Enter the URL you want the webhook to send its payload to and select whether you want it to use a POST or PUT HTTP method. If you need to, click Send Test Webhook to test your webhook configuration. The panel on the card shows what the payload will look like. Note The body of the webhook payload is always the Shipment Events resource for the shipment that triggered the webhook. When you're happy with your setup, click Create to create the webhook. And we're done! Every time a shipment falls into a state of Delivered To Neighbour , Delivered to Reception or Delivered to Safe Location , REACT will send the Shipment Events resource for that shipment, along with any headers you configured, to the URL you specified. The next steps are up to you. Following our example, you might integrate the webhook payload with your SMS gateway. However, you can use the data from REACT webhooks in any way you choose. The possibilities are limitless! For more information on creating and maintaining shipment filters and webhooks, see the Managing Webhooks page.

Note The Settings section also features webhook and shipment filter setup pages. These pages are covered in detail on the Managing Webhooks page. Setting up API Keys API keys enable you to use REACT's APIs. If you attempt to make an API request without a valid API key then REACT returns a 401 Unauthorized response. All REACT API keys offer access to all of REACT's API endpoints. For a full list of REACT's API endpoints, see the API Reference . Creating a New API Key From the REACT dashboard, select Settings > API Keys to display the Create & Manage API Keys page. Click Create new API key to display the Create New API Key tile. If required, enter a name for your API key into the Name your API key field. This step is optional, but highly recommended. Entering a name makes it easier to identify your key on the Create & Manage API Keys page. Click Create . REACT displays a dialog box with your API key in it. Click Copy to copy your API key to the clipboard. REACT displays a message when your key has been successfully copied. You should then paste the key into a secure file (that is, a file that can't be accessed by anyone who you wouldn't want to give you API key to). Warning It's really important that you make a note of your API key, as you can't come back and view it later. To use your key, add an x-api-key header to any requests you make. This lets REACT know who you are, and makes sure that only authorised people and applications can get at your data. Renaming API Keys To rename an existing API key, open the Settings > API Keys UI page and click Rename on the key you want to rename. React displays the Rename your API Key tile. Enter a new name and click Update to rename the key. Renaming an API key only changes that key's identifier on the Create & Manage API Keys page. It does not affect the key itself. Revoking Existing API Keys To revoke an existing API key, open the Settings > API Keys UI page and click Revoke on the key you want to revoke. Click Yes on the confirmation dialog to revoke the key. Revoking an API key deletes it permanently, and means that any API calls you have set up using that key will no longer work. If you attempt to send an API request using a key that has been revoked then REACT returns a 401 Unauthorized response. User Access Only Admin users can create and delete API keys. Setting up SFTP Accounts Setting up a REACT SFTP account enables you to upload shipments via REACT's SFTP file upload service. There is no limit to the number of SFTP accounts you can set up. To set up an SFTP account: From the REACT dashboard, select Settings > SFTP Account to display the SFTP Accounts page. Click the Create SFTP Account tile to open the Creating an SFTP Account page. Enter a Username and Password . Your Username must have at least five characters and be unique (that is, you cannot have two keys with the same Username ). Your Password must have at least eight characters. Click Create to create the account. REACT automatically generates a PPK key for your SFTP account and downloads it to your browser's default download location. You should then ensure that the key file is stored safely (that is, in a location that can't be accessed by anyone who you wouldn't want to upload shipments on behalf of your organisation). Note For more information on uploading shipment data to REACT via SFTP, see the Registering Shipments by SFTP section of the Registering Shipments page. User Access Only Admin users can view, edit and delete SFTP accounts. Setting up Carrier Connectors Carrier connectors enable REACT to obtain carrier tracking data. Setting up a connector for a particular carrier means that REACT can keep its records of that carrier's shipments up to date. You must already have an account with the carrier in order to successfully set up a carrier connector. Adding New Carrier Connectors From the REACT UI, select Settings > Carrier Connectors to display the Set Up & Manage Carrier Connectors page. Click Connect on the tile of the carrier connector you want to set up. Available carrier connectors are displayed as tiles in the All Carrier Connectors available section of the screen. Note Some carriers may display more than one connector. This is because, for these carriers, there are multiple integration methods that REACT can use to get the carrier's data. For example, a particular carrier may allow REACT to get data by API, file download, and web scraping. You should use whichever connection method your carrier account grants you access to. REACT displays the Create Configuration page for that connector. Enter the required details. The information required varies from carrier to carrier. Click the check box at the bottom to confirm that you give permission for REACT to retrieve tracking events on your behalf and then click Save to create the connector. Note The Create Configuration page displays the carrier's REACT reference in the Carrier Reference field. This is a unique identifier generated by REACT for all carrier integrations, and can used when registering shipments as a means of explicitly telling REACT where to look to get tracking information. For more information on assigning carriers at shipment registration, see the Assigning a Carrier on Registration section of the Registering Shipments page. If required, you can set up multiple instances of the same connector. For example, you might have multiple accounts with a particular carrier. In this circumstance, each of those accounts would need its own connector. Editing Existing Carrier Connectors To edit an existing carrier connector, open the Settings > Carrier Connectors UI page and click Edit on the connector you want to edit. Existing carrier connectors are displayed as tiles in the Current Carrier Connectors section of the screen. REACT displays the Edit Configuration page for that carrier. Make the required edits and click Save to save your changes. Deactivating Existing Carrier Connectors To deactivate an existing carrier connector, open the Settings > Carrier Connectors UI page and click the Active toggle on the connector's tile. The toggle switches to the Inactive position, confirming that the connector has been deactivated. Deactivating a carrier connector means that REACT can no longer retrieve data via that carrier integration. However, the carrier's configuration is saved, and the carrier can be reactivated by clicking the toggle again. To permanently disconnect a carrier, open the Settings > Carrier Connectors UI page and click the Disconnect button on the connector's tile. A confirmation dialog is displayed. Click Yes to disconnect the carrier. Disconnecting a carrier connector deactivates it and deletes all of its configuration. To reinstate a disconnected carrier connector you would need to set it up again as a new connector. User Access Only Admin users can view, edit and delete carrier connectors. Setting up Custom State Labels Shipment state labels enable you to explain shipment states in your own brand tone of voice, using language that your customers will understand. REACT returns shipment state labels in the state_label field of the Shipment , Shipment Event , and Shipment Tracking Event resources. REACT's Customise Shipment State Labels page enables you to configure custom shipment state labels in the following languages: English (United Kingdom) English (United States) German (Germany) French (France) Spanish (Spain) Italian (Italy) Russian Japanese All shipment state label fields are optional. If you leave a label field blank, then REACT returns the shipment state's default name as the label. To set up custom shipment state labels: Open the Settings > Custom State Labels UI page to display REACT's shipment states. Each shipment state tile contains any labels that are currently configured for that state. Tip The Filter States buttons at the top of the page enable you to filter the states displayed by red / amber / green status. Click the Edit button on the state you want to edit. The edit page for that state is displayed. Enter the required labels for that shipment state into the language fields and then click Save to save your changes. Selecting Label Language By default, REACT's APIs and webhooks return labels in en-gb (English - United Kingdom). To retrieve labels in languages other than en-gb , add an accept-language header with the relevant language code as its value to your API request. For example, to retrieve language labels in German, you would first need to use the Customise Shipment State Labels page to add German labels to your shipment states. You would then add an accept-language header with a value of de to any API requests you made. In its responses, REACT would populate the state_label field with your German labels. User Access Admin and Marketing users can view, edit and delete custom state labels. Dashboard users do not have access to this feature.

This page explains how REACT tracking pages work, how to set up new pages, and how to manage your existing pages. What Is A Tracking Page? A REACT tracking page is a customisable microsite, hosted by Sorted, that displays status and event information about an individual shipment or group of shipments. Your customers can track their order simply by visiting the link that corresponds to their shipment. All REACT tracking pages display a grid of page elements, such as tracking information, text, or graphics. The Create Tracking Page editor enables you to create and position these elements, as well as specifying design choices such as colours and fonts. You can create as many tracking page layouts as you need. For example, a shoe retailer could use different custom layouts to track men's, women's, and kid's shoes. You can also use the Create Tracking Page editor to create custom \"shipment not found\" pages to display if a customer tries to track a shipment using invalid details. Note This page explains how to set up tracking pages using REACT's Create Tracking Page UI option. It does not cover integrating your own websites or apps with REACT's tracking API. For information on using REACT to power tracking within your own websites or apps, see the Retrieving Shipment and Event Data page. Creating New Tracking Pages To create a new page layout, select Settings > Tracking Pages and select the Create New Tracking Page tile to display the Create Tracking Page menu. The Create Tracking Page menu has seven sections: Link - Displays sharable tracking links to your page. General - Configure general details about your page, including default titles, colours and fonts. Nav Bar - Customise the look and feel of your page's nav bar. Nav Items - Configure the links that will appear on your page's nav bar. Desktop Layout - Select the elements you want your tracking page to display when viewed on a desktop computer, and specify where these elements should be placed. Mobile Layout - Select the elements you want your tracking page to display when viewed on a mobile device. Page Overrides - If required, select an alternative tracking page (i.e. a custom \"shipment not found\" page) to display in the event that a customer searches for a shipment using invalid details. To see what your page would look like while you're configuring it, click Preview at the top of the page. To save your page before publishing, click Save . Bear in mind that you can't change the Title of your page once it's been saved. To publish your page, click Publish . Publishing your page makes it accessible to customers. Configuring General Page Details To configure general page details: Enter a Tracking Page Name for the layout. This value is used as part of the page's link. Note Choose your page's Tracking Page Name carefully, as you can't update it once you've saved the page. Note that you can't have two pages with the same Tracking Page Name . For more information on how your customers can access tracking pages once they are published, see the Publishing Your Page section. Enter a Title for your page. This value is displayed on the page's browser tab, and is also used as the title of the page's tile on the Create & Manage Tracking Pages menu. Select whether you want the Carrier Link to be Active or Inactive . All REACT tracking pages include a carrier tracking reference. If you set the Carrier Link to Active , then clicking on this reference takes customers to the relevant carrier tracking portal. Select a Favicon by clicking the Upload button and selecting an image from the dialog box. There is no size limit on this individual image, but your page cannot exceed more than 5MB of images in total. Select the default font that REACT should use on the page. Specify a default Font Size . Select a Font Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. Select a default Font Weight . Configuring the Nav Bar All REACT tracking pages have a nav bar at the top. The nav bar contains links to locations of your choice. For example, a clothing retailer might create links from their tracking page to the men's, women's, and kid's sections of their online store. Configuring Nav Bar Appearance To configure the appearance of your page's nav bar, use the Navbar panel: Select a Logo by clicking the Upload button and selecting an image from the dialog box. There is no size limit on this individual image, but your page cannot exceed more than 5MB of images in total. The logo is automatically resized to fit the nav bar, and is displayed on the top-left of the page. Enter a web link into the Root URL field. Users are redirected to this link when they click the page's logo. Select a Background Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. This is the colour of the nav bar itself. Select a Border Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. This is the colour of the border at the bottom of the nav bar. Select the font that REACT should use on the nav bar. Select a Font Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. This is the colour of the nav bar's text. Select a Font Size and Font Weight for the nav bar's text. Note The font options on the Navbar panel override any page-wide options you may have selected in the General panel. Configuring Nav Bar Links To add items to your page's nav bar, use the Nav Items panel: Click the Add a new nav item tile. REACT displays the Add Link dialog. Enter the Text that you want the item to display. Enter the URL that you want the item to link to. Click the Update button to close the dialog and add the nav link. To rearrange an existing nav bar item, click Edit and select Move Up or Move Down as required. Moving an item up the list moves it to the left on the displayed tracking page, and vice versa. To delete an existing nav bar item, click Edit and select Delete . Configuring Page Layout REACT tracking pages offer separate, fully responsive layouts for desktop and mobile. You can configure these layouts via the Desktop and Mobile panels. Tracking pages are laid out on a grid system, with each layout having up to six rows, and each row having up to four columns on desktop, and a single column on mobile. Each column can contain a single page element (such as tracking widgets, text or images). As an example, the following graphic shows a desktop page made up of the following elements: A large-height top row containing three columns, with two images and the tracking widget itself. A small-height middle row containing four columns, all of which contain text links. A medium-height bottom row containing two columns, with both containing images. Editing Rows To add new rows: Click the Add a row tile on either the Desktop or Mobile panel to display the Add Row dialog. Select the row Height required. If you are setting up a row in the desktop layout, select the number of Columns the row should have. This option is not available for mobile layouts, as all mobile rows have one column. Click Add to close the dialog and add the new row. To delete an existing row, click the row's Edit button and then click Delete . Configuring Page Elements REACT supports the following page element types: Status_timeline - A tracking widget displaying the shipment's current status, estimated delivery date and a timeline of tracking events. If no tracking information is available, REACT displays a blank widget. Text + Image - Displays an image with accompanying overlay text. Text - Text only. Image - An image with no text. To configure row elements, click Edit on the element you want to configure to display the Edit Column dialog. Next, select the Type of element you want to add. The fields required differ depending on element type. Status Timeline To configure a Status Timeline element: Select Status Timeline from the Type menu. Select whether you want to view Locale labels or Shipment State labels from the Choose Display Type menu. If you select Locale labels, then the page will display your custom shipment state labels instead of state names. If you select Shipment State labels, then the page will display default state names. Note For more information on configuring custom shipment labels, see the Setting up Custom State Labels section of the Settings page. If you selected Locale in the previous step, select which locale you want to use for the page's labels from the Locale menu. Select the font that REACT should use on the element. Select a Font Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. Select a Font Size and Font Weight for the element's text. Note You can only add Status Timeline elements to the top row of your tracking page. The option is not displayed when editing elements on lower rows. Image + Text To configure an Image + Text element: Select Image + Text from the Type menu. Select an Image by clicking the Upload button and selecting an image from the dialog box. There is no size limit on this individual image, but your page cannot exceed more than 5MB of images in total. Enter the Text you want the element to display. Select a Text Position . This is the position in which the text will be displayed within the element, enabling you to avoid having key parts of your image obscured by text. If required, enter a Redirection URL . Users are redirected to this link when they click the element. Select the font that REACT should use on the element. Select a Font Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. Select a Font Size and Font Weight for the element's text. Text To configure a Text element: Select Text from the Type menu. Enter the Text you want the element to display. Select a Text Position . This is the position in which the text will be displayed within the element. Enter a Redirection URL . Users are redirected to this link when they click the element. Select the font that REACT should use on the element. Select a Font Colour by clicking the Select button and choosing a colour from the picker. Select a Font Size and Font Weight for the element's text. Image To configure an Image element: Select Image from the Type menu. Select an Image by clicking the Upload button and selecting an image from the dialog box. There is no size limit on this individual image, but your page cannot exceed more than 5MB of images in total. Enter a Redirection URL . Users are redirected to this link when they click the element. Lastly, click Save to close the dialog and save the element's details. To edit an exiting element, click its Edit button to display the Edit Column dialog. To delete an existing element, click its trash icon and then click Yes on the confirmation dialog. Configuring Custom Shipment Not Found Pages The Page Overrides panel enables you to select a tracking page for REACT to display in the event that a customer searches for a shipment using invalid details (for example by providing a shipment_id that does not match any registered shipments). Note REACT only displays the selected override page in circumstances where a user has attempted to track a shipment using a valid REACT tracking page name but invalid shipment details. If the user enters an invalid tracking page name, then REACT always displays a generic 404 page. See the Linking to Individual Shipments page for a breakdown of the link structure of REACT tracking pages. Use the Invalid Tracking Ref page override drop-down to select the page you want REACT to display when a shipment cannot be found. This drop-down displays a list of all your available tracking pages. Note that, as you can create multiple tracking pages, you can use the Create Tracking Page editor to create a purpose-built \"shipment not found\" page. For example, you could create a page with text elements containing \"what to do next\" information or contact details, and then select that page as the override for all your other tracking pages. If you select a page with a tracking widget, then REACT displays that page with a \"no events available\" notice should a customer search for a shipment that can't be found, as shown in the below example: By default, the Invalid Tracking Ref page override drop-down is set to None . If you do not select a tracking page, then REACT displays a generic 404 page when a customer searches for a shipment that can't be found. Publishing Your Page Once you're happy with your page, click Publish to publish it. You can now share the link to the page with your customers. The Link panel displays sharable links to your page, using various combinations of shipment properties to identify the shipment or shipment group to be tracked. Linking to Individual Shipments Links to individual pages take the format https://react.sorted.com/tracking/[page_Title]?customer_Id=[customer_Id]&shipment_Id=[shipment_Id]&tracking_reference=[tracking_reference]&custom_reference=[custom_reference] , where page_Title is the title of your tracking page and customer_Id is your REACT customer ID. There are three search parameters you can use when passing links to your consumer so that they can identify an individual shipment; shipment_Id , tracking_reference and custom_reference . REACT uses the following logic when identifying shipments to be tracked: If you specify a shipment_Id then REACT uses that value alone to identify the shipment, as the REACT Shipment ID is a unique identifier for every shipment registered with REACT. If you specify a tracking_reference , custom_reference , or both, then REACT searches for all shipments with those details created in the last month and displays details for the first shipment found. If no parameters are provided, the REACT returns an error. As an example, suppose that a retailer with a customer_Id of cs_1234567890 creates a page with a page_Title of awesomepage . That retailer then registers a shipment with the following details: shipment_Id of sp_0987654321 tracking_reference of demo_tracking_ref custom_reference of demo_custom_ref In order for that shipment's consumer to track the page, the retailer passes the following link to the consumer: https://react.sorted.com/tracking/awesomepage?customer_Id=cs_1234567890&shipment_Id=sp_0987654321 However, if the retailer did not have the REACT shipment ID of that shipment to hand, they could also pass the below link to the consumer: https://react.sorted.com/tracking/awesomepage?customer_Id=cs_1234567890&tracking_reference=demo_tracking_ref&custom_reference=demo_custom_ref In this example, both of these links would point to the same shipment. Linking to Shipment Groups REACT shipment groups are collections of shipments that share a common metadata property. Grouped shipments can be tracked from the same tracking page, with a drop-down picker on the tracking widget enabling the customer to select which shipment's tracking information they want to view. This is useful in circumstances where an order would take more than one shipment to fulfil, for example. Tracking page links to shipment groups take the format https://react.sorted.com/tracking/[page_title]?customer_id=[customer_id_here]&metadata_key=[metadata_key_here]&metadata_value=[metadata_value_here] , where [page_title] is the title of your tracking page, [customer_id_here] is your REACT customer ID, and the metadata key and value are the properties that the shipments share. As an example, suppose that a customer with a customer_id of cs_1234567890 creates a tracking page called examplePage . The customer then registers two shipments from the same order, grouping them together using a metadata key of order_ref with a value of 1234 . To enable their customer to track both shipments on the order from the same page, they would share the following link: https://react.sorted.com/tracking/examplePage?customer_id=cs_1234567890&metadata_key=order_ref&metadata_value=1234 Note that REACT only displays the drop-down shipment picker and grouping information if you access the shipment via the shipment group link (that is, you use the shared metadata key and value to identify the shipments to be displayed). You can still use other valid tracking page link formats to view a shipment that is in a group, but REACT does not display links to other shipments in the group in this case. Note For more information on grouping REACT shipments, see the Grouping Shipments page. Managing Existing Pages To edit an existing page, select Settings > Tracking Pages to display the Create & Manage Tracking Pages menu, and click the View button on the page's tile. The process of editing an existing page is the same as that used to set up a new page. To preview an existing page, click the context menu on the page's tile and select Preview from the drop-down menu. To duplicate an existing page, click the context menu on the page's tile and select Duplicate from the drop-down menu. To delete an existing page, click the context menu on the page's tile and select Delete from the drop-down menu. User Access Admin and Marketing users can view, edit and delete tracking pages. Dashboard users do not have access to this feature. Next Steps Learn more about the REACT UI: Monitoring Shipments Settings User Management"

This page explains how to invite new users, how to define user permissions, and how to revoke user access. Inviting New Users To invite a new user to REACT: Select Account > Manage Users to display the Add User page. Click the Add User tile. The Add a New User page is displayed. Enter the First Name , Last Name and User Email of the person you want to invite. You cannot use an email account that is already associated with a REACT account. Enter the User Role you want that person to have. REACT has three user roles: Admin , Marketing and Dashboard . Note A user's role defines what that person can view and/or edit within REACT. In general, Admin users have extensive read/write access to the system, Marketing users can view most parts of the UI and edit certain parts, and Dashboard users have limited read-only access. For full permission details for each role, see the User Roles section. Click Invite to send an invitation email to the address entered. REACT creates a tile for that user on the Add Users page. Invitations are valid for 24 hours. To re-send an invite, click the Re-send Email button on the user's tile. This button disappears once the user has registered their account. To revoke a pending invite, click the context menu button on the user's tile, click Delete , and then click Yes on the confirmation dialog. The previously-invited user will no longer be able to register for REACT. Responding to Invites To register for REACT, users must: Click the Accept Invitation button in the invite email within 24 hours of the invite being sent. If the user does not respond within 24 hours then they will need to request a new invite. REACT displays the Register page. Enter the following information: First Name Last Name Password (requires confirmation) Select the Agreement check box and click Register to finish confirming registration details. The newly-registered user is logged in and taken to the States dashboard. Editing Registered Users To edit a registered user, click Edit on that user's tile to display the Edit User screen. The Edit User screen enables you to edit a user's display name and role, but not their email address. Click Save to confirm your changes. Removing Users To delete an existing user account, click the context menu button on the user's tile, click Delete , and then click Yes on the confirmation dialog. Deleting a user permanently revokes their REACT access. The user would need to be sent a new invite in order to re-gain access. Note You cannot delete your organisation's primary REACT user account (i.e. the user account that was created during the initial customer setup process). User Roles REACT users can have one of three different roles: Admin , Marketing , and Dashboard . A user's role determines what that user can view and edit within the REACT UI. Admin users can assign user roles via the Manage Users page. This section explains configuration and access information for each user role. Admin Admin users have the highest level of access to REACT. They are the only users that can add, edit and delete user accounts. Each REACT customer is limited to four admin users. However, admin users can transfer admin access between accounts, or delete admin accounts altogether where required. Caution For security reasons, we recommend that you only create as many admin user accounts as you need to. Each organisation has a primary user. This is the user that was created during the initial customer setup process. Primary users have the same access rights as a regular admin user, but cannot be deleted. If you want to delete your organisation's primary user, please contact Sorted support. Marketing Users Marketing users have the middle level of REACT access. They can view most parts of the UI, but can only edit certain pages. Each organisation can only have six Marketing users at any one time. Admin users can add, edit and delete marketing user access. Dashboard Users Dashboard users have the lowest level of REACT access. They can only view and edit certain screens. This is the user role that you would likely assign to customer service operatives. There is no limit to the number of dashboard users that an organisation can have. Admin users can add, edit and delete dashboard user access.
